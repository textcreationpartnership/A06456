            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE AVTHOR to the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He occaſion (gentle Reader) of Printing the Second Part of <hi>Lazarillo de Tormes</hi> hath beene, that there came to my hands a little Pamphlet, which treats of his Life, without any likelyhood of truth. The greateſt part of it is ſtufft, with telling how <hi>Lazaro</hi> fell into the Sea, where he was turned into a Fiſh called a Tunny, and liued there many yeeres, marrying with a ſhee Tunny, by whom he had Children, as much Fiſhes as the Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It relateth alſo the Warres that the Tunnies made, <hi>Lazaro</hi> being their Captaine, and many other Tales, as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
<pb facs="tcp:5419:6"/> as falſe, and as ill grounded as fooliſh. And queſtionleſſe, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it had a mind to vtter ſome fooliſh Dreame, or ſome dreamed folly. That Booke (I ſay) hath been the firſt motiue, that hath moued me to bring to light this ſecond Part, word for word, without adding or diminiſhing, as I haue ſeen it written in certain Scroules kept in the Treaſurie of Records of the Beggars of <hi>Toledo,</hi> and as I haue heard it a hundred times told by my Grandmother, and Aunts, by the Fires ſide in the Winter nights, and with the which my Nurſe hath weaned me. For the better confirmation, I remember how they and others of our neighbours would diſpute, How it could be poſsible that <hi>Lazaro</hi> could be ſo long vnder water (as is ſaid in this ſecond Part) without drowning? Some held <hi>pro,</hi> and the others, <hi>con.</hi> The firſt quoted <hi>Lazaro</hi> himſelfe; who ſaid, That the Water could not get into him, by reaſon
<pb facs="tcp:5419:6"/> that he was filled and crammed vp to the very mouth. A good old man, well skild in swimming, to proue that to be an eaſie matter, interpoſed his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, affirming, That hee had ſeene a man, who going to ſwimme in the riuer <hi>Tagus,</hi> diued vnder Water, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in certaine Caues from Sunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet vntill next morning, that by the Sun-ſhine he did find the way out: and when as his Parents and Friends were wearie of bewayling and ſeeking his Body, to giue it buriall, he came forth ſafe and ſound. The other difficultie that they found in his life, was, That no body did take <hi>Lazaro</hi> for a man, and that as many as ſaw him, ſhould take him for Fiſh. To this anſwered a good Canon (who by reaſon that he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry old, did commonly ſit in the Sunne among the Diſtaffe-Spinſters) That it was moſt likely of all, as agreeing with the opinion of many ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne Writers, as among others, <hi>Pliny,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:5419:7"/> 
               <hi>Aelian, Ariſtotle, Albertus Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> who affirme, That there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Fiſhes in the Sea, the Males they call <hi>Titons,</hi> &amp; the Females <hi>Nereids,</hi> and all of them Sea-men, who from the Girdle upward haue the ſhape of perfect Men, and from thence downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Fiſhes. And I ſay, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that opinion had not beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by ſo well approued Authors; yet the Licence that the Fiſhermen had from the Lords Inquiſitors, might ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to excuſe the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ignorance, ſeeing it had been a caſe of Inquiſition to haue doubted of a matter which their Lordſhips had conſented ſhould be ſhowne for ſuch. And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (though out of my compaſſe) I wil relate an accident that befell a labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring man of my Countrey: which was, That one of the Inquiſitors hauing ſent for him, to begge ſome of his Peares of him, which hee had heard were excellent; the poore Clowne
<pb facs="tcp:5419:7"/> not knowing why his Lordſhip ſhould ſend for him, was ſo skared, that hee fell ſicke vpon it, till that by the meanes of a friend of his hee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the buſineſſe: And then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſtarting from his Bed, he ranne into his Garden, pluckt vp the Tree by the roote, and preſently ſent it with the Fruit, ſaying, hee would not keepe in his houſe an occaſion for their Lordſhips to ſend for him another time; ſo great is the feare that not onely labouring men, and the baſer ſort of people, but euen the Lords and Grands haue of them. All of them tremble when they heare theſe words, <hi>Inquiſitor,</hi> and <hi>Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> more then the Leaues vpon the Tree with the gentle <hi>Zephirus.</hi> This is that which I haue beene willing to warne the Reader of that he may be the readier to anſwer, when ſuch Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhall be propounded in his preſence.
<pb facs="tcp:5419:8"/> If hee accept this Second Part, let him expect the Third, with the Death and Teſtament of <hi>Lazarillo;</hi> which is the beſt of all: If not, hee may at leaſt receiue my good will. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</p>

I parted from <hi>Toledo</hi> iouiall, ſtately, and content (as all are that goe to the Warres) puft vp with glorious hopes, accompanied with a great number of friends, and neighbors, that went the ſame Voyage, carried with a deſire of bettering their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Wee came to <hi>Murcia,</hi> with intention to goe ſhippe our ſelues at <hi>Cartagena:</hi> where, there befell me that which I little wiſhed, to make me know, that Fortune, who had ſet me on the toppe of her vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant Wheele, and aduanced me to the higheſt degree of earthly felicitie, began alreadie (in her ſwift
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:5419:10"/> courſe) to hurle me downe head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the loweſt. The chaunce was, that comming to our Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, I ſaw a ſemy-man, who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med rather a hee Goat, by reaſon of his ragged and tottered Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: his Hat was pulled downe ouer his eyes, ſo that I could by no meanes ſee his face; hee leaned his cheeke vpon his hand, and had his legge croſſe ouer his Sword, which he wore in a halfe Scabbard made of Liſts: his Hat (right Beggars Blocke) had no crowne, the better to euaporate the humours of his head: his Doublet was of the <hi>French</hi> faſhion, ſo cut and ſlaſht with wearing, as there was not a piece left bigge ynough, to wrap vp halfe a frathing worth of Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min Seed in: his Shirt was of fleſh, which might be ſeene through the Grate of his Garment; his Bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were ſutable: his Stockings,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:5419:11"/> the one red, the other greene, came ſcarce to his Anckles; his Shooes without Soles, were as good to be drawne as carried. By a Cocks Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which hee wore in his Hat, I thought hee ſhould be a Souldier; With this imagination, I asked him from whence he was, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee went? Hee caſting vp his eyes, to ſee who hee was that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned him, ſtraight knew me, and likewiſe I him; it was the Squire whom I had ſerued in <hi>Toledo:</hi> I was aſtoniſhed to ſee him in ſuch a pickle. Hee obſeruing my amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſaid to me; I maruell not (friend <hi>Lazaro)</hi> if thou doeſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſee me in this Equipage: but anon thou ſhalt leaue wondring, when I haue told thee what hath happened vnto me, ſince the time that I left thee in <hi>Toledo</hi> vntill now. Returning to my Lodging, with the change of my Piſtolet to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:5419:11"/> my Creditors, I met with a Woman, cloſe wrapt vp in her Veyle; who pulling mee by the Cloake, with teares, and ſighes, mingled with ſobs, entreated mee earneſtly to be fauourable vnto her, in an vrgent neceſſitie. I bad her ſpeake her griefe, which ſhe ſhould be longer in telling, then I in hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. Shee continuing her wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, with a maidenly ſhamefaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſaid, That the courteſie which I was to doe her, and whereof ſhee was to requeſt me, was, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie her vnto <hi>Madrid,</hi> where ſhee was told, that a Gentleman was, who not content to haue diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured her, had alſo robbed her of all her Iewels, without any regard to the promiſe of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age which hee had giuen her; and that if I would doe this for her, ſhee would doe for mee what a thankfull woman is obliged to doe.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:5419:12"/> I comforted her after the beſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that I could; giuing her this hope, that if her enemie were to be found in the World, ſhee might hold her ſelfe alreadie reuenged. To conclude, without any delay we ſet forward towards the Court, whitherto I bare all the charges. The good Damſell (that knew well whither ſhe went) carried me to a Band of Souldiers, who receiued her with all chearefulneſſe, and brought her before the Captaine, to haue her enrolled for one of their Cockatrices: Then turning her ſelfe towards me, with a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and brazen countenance ſhee ſaid, Farewell Maſter Lubber, I haue now no more need of you. I ſeeing my ſelfe thus gull'd, began to rage and foame at my mouth, telling her, that if ſhee had beene a man, as well as ſhee was a woman, I would haue pulled her Soule vp
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:5419:12"/> by the roots out of her Body. A petty Souldier among the reſt roſe vp to me, and laying his hand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my face, made me aduance a Baboones Snowt; not daring to giue me a boxe on the eare; which if hee had, his Graue might haue beene digged in the ſame place. When I ſaw the matter grow worſe and worſe, Mum ſayd I, and went my way a little faſter then ordinarie, to trie if ſome tall fellow or other durſt haue follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mee, that wee might haue cut one anothers throat; for had I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred with any of the baſer ſtampe, and had killed him (as without doubt I had) what honour or what credite had I gotten? But if the Captaine had come forth, or ſome Swaſh-buckler, I would haue giuen him more ſlaſhes then there is Sand in the Sea. When I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that none durſt follow me,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:5419:13"/> I went away very well pleaſed. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, I ſought for a Seruice, and becauſe I could not finde ſuch a one as I deſerue, I am as thou ſeeſt mee. The troth is, that I might haue beene Butler or Vſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to fiue or ſixe Botcher-Wiues; Offices, that though I were readie to ſtarue, I would not accept of. Finally, my good Maſter ſaid, that becauſe hee could not meete with certaine Marchants of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, who would haue lent him Money, hee was without it, and knew not whither to goe that Night. I, that ſtraight ſmelt his meaning, inuited him to the halfe of my Bed, and Supper; which offer hee willingly accepted. As wee went to Bed, I deſired him not to lay his Clothes vpon it, becauſe it was too little for ſo much companie. The next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, thinking to riſe without
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:5419:13"/> any noyſe, I reached my hand to my Clothes, but I found <hi>Blancko;</hi> for the Slaue had ſtollen them, and was gone away with them. I thought verily I ſhould haue died in my Bed for ſorrow: and it had beene farre better for me, for then had I eſcaped the many deaths, which ſince I haue ſuffered. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to cry as loud as I could, Theeues, Theeues; which thoſe of the houſe hearing, came vp, and found me as a Swimmer new come out of the Water, ſeeking in euery corner of the Chamber ſomething to couer me. They all fell a laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as if they had beene mad, and I a ſwearing, like a Carman. I gaue to the Diuel that Theefe, and brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Cheater, who halfe the night long had kept mee awake, with tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mee the greatneſſe of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and kindred. All the remedie that for that time I could finde (no
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:5419:14"/> body helping mee with a better) was to trie, if the Garments of that ſaid Braggadocio could fit mee, till God had ſent mee ſome others. But it was a Labyrinth; they had neither beginning, nor ending: there was no difference betwixt Breeches, and Ierkin. I thruſt my Legges into the Sleeues, and wore the Breeches for a Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blet; not forgetting the Stoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, which ſeemed to bee ſome Chandlers drawing Sleeues: the Shooes were like Shackles about my Legges, becauſe they wanted Soles. I blockt on the Hat, the Crowne downeward, becauſe it was leſſe greaſie. And as for the troupes that trauelled ouer me on foot and horſebacke, I let them paſſe. In this Habit went I to my Maſter, who had ſent to call mee; who wondering to ſee ſuch a skare-Crow, fell into ſuch a laughter,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:5419:14"/> that his backe-ſtrings ſlackening, hee could hold no longer, but made fluſh; the which (for his credite) it is fitting ones tongue ſhould paſſe ouer with ſilence. After a thouſand ſtoppes, hee as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked mee the reaſon of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe; I told it him: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, in ſtead of taking pittie of mee, hee chid mee, and turned mee out of doores, ſaying, That as then I had brought that man into my Bedde; ſo another time, I would doe the like with ſome other, that would robbe him.</p>

               <p>I Alwayes haue had a gift, not to ſtay long with one Maſter; no more did I with this, though not by my fault. I ſaw my ſelfe forſaken, alone, and diſtreſſed; in ſuch plight, as euery one would thruſt mee from him, gybing and laughing at mee. One would tell mee, That Hat with a Back-doore, is not much amiſſe; it lookes like a Dutch-womans Cappe: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would ſay, That Doublet is of the Faſhion, it is like a Hogge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie; and the rather, ſeeing your Worſhip is in it: they runne ſo thicke, that hee might kill them, and ſend them ſalted to the good Lady his Wife. A Snap-ſacke-bearer ſaid to mee, Fore God Sir
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:5419:15"/> 
                  <hi>Lazaro,</hi> thoſe Stockings make you a very good Calfe. Euery one did ſo ſcoffe and flout mee, that I was in minde to returne home againe, but that I thought, that there would be but poore Warres, if I ſhould not get more then I had loſt. That, that grieued mee moſt, was, that they fled from me as from one that were infected. Wee tooke ſhipping at <hi>Cartagena:</hi> the Ship was great, and well prouided. They hoyſted vp the Sailes, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to the Winde, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed it, &amp; droue it with great ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The ſhore vaniſhed from our ſight, and the Sea begun to ſwell with a contrary Wind, which ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Billowes vnto the Clouds. The tempeſt encreaſed, &amp; our hope diminiſhed. The Mariners &amp; Pilots gaue vs ouer: The wayling &amp; wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping was ſo great, that me thought we were at a <hi>Good-friday</hi> correction.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:5419:16"/> The noyſe was ſo great, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what was commanded, could bee vnderſtood: The one runn'd to one place, the other to another: wee all ſeemed Braziers. Euery one confeſſed himſelfe to whom hee could: ſuch there were as confeſſed themſelues to a Punke; who gaue them the abſolution af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as good a manner, as if ſhee had exerciſed the Office many yeeres. It is good angling in a muddie Water: When I ſaw that they were all buſie, I ſaid to my ſelfe, Die then, and die full. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I went downe to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the Ship, where there was great ſtore of Bread, Wine, Paſties, and Preſerues, for no body ſaid ſo much as, what make you heere? I began to eate of all, and to fill my belly, that I might haue prouiſion ynough till Doomes-day. In the meane time there came a Souldier
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:5419:16"/> to me, deſiring me to ſhriue him: Who, amazed to ſee me with ſo good Cheere, and Appetite, asked me, How I could eate, ſeeing death before mine eyes? I anſwered him, That I did it for feare leſt the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, which I was to drinke in my drowning, ſhould doe mee any harme. This my ſimplicitie, made him fetch a laugh from his heeles. Many confeſſed themſelues to me, not able to vtter one true word for griefe and feare; nor I to hearken vnto them, for haſt that I had to fill my ſelfe. The Captaines, and men of note, with two Prieſts that were there, ſaued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in the Cock-boat. I being ill apparrelled, could not be receiued into it. When I had eaten my fill, I went me to a Hogs-head of good Wine, and there powring downe my Throat as much as euer I could, I forgot both my ſelfe and the Tempeſt. The
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:5419:17"/> Ship ouerturned, and the Water came in, as in her home. A Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall taking hold of both my hands amidſt the pangs of death, deſired mee to heare a ſinne where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hee would confeſſe himſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me; which was, That he had not fulfilled a Pennance which had bin enioyned him, to goe on Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to our Lady of <hi>Loretta,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing had many opportunities to effect it; and that then, when hee would, hee could not. I told him, that by the authoritie which I had receiued, I did change it him; and that in ſtead of going to our Lady of <hi>Loretta,</hi> he ſhould go to S. <hi>Iames.</hi> Alas Sir (ſaid hee) how willingly would I accompliſh this Pennance; but already the water begins to get into my mouth ſo that I cannot. If it be ſo, ſaid I againe, I enioyne you for your Pennance to drinke all the water of the Sea: but he did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:5419:17"/> it, by reaſon that there were others that drunke as much as hee. The water comming to my mouth, I cryed out, To another doore, for this cannot open; and although it had beene open, yet could it not haue entred, becauſe my body was ſo full of Wine, that it lookt like a puft Bladder. At the noyſe of the cracking of the Ship, came a great quantitie of Fiſh, eating the fleſh of the Wretches that were drowned (and not in a little Water) as if they fed in a Common. In the little time that I was a going to the bottome, and comming vp againe, I ſaw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible things: An infinite number of Bones, and Bodies of Men; great ſtore of Coffers, full of Money and Iewels, great quantitie of Armes, Silkes, Linnen, and Spices. I had a great mind to all, and it grieued me much, that I had it not all ſafe at home, with which (as a <hi>Biſcay</hi> ſaid)
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:5419:18"/> I would eat my Bread printed with <hi>Sardaines.</hi> If I could but get out theſe Riches now (ſaid I to my ſelfe) no Inne-keeper in the World ſhould fare more delicately then I. I would build Houſes, eſtabliſh Reuenewes, and purchaſe a Garden in the <hi>Zigarrales.</hi> My Wife ſhould <note place="margin">

Euery one would come and congratulate mee, and I would tell them, that I had wraught fairely, drawing my Wealth, not out of the entrailes of the Earth, but from the very heart of the Sea: not wet with ſweat, but through wet with water, as any dried <hi>Poore-Iohn.</hi> In all my life, I was neuer ſo content as then; not conſidering, that if I opened my mouth, I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine there buried with the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, for euer and a day.</p>

               <p>SEeing my ſelfe ſo neere vnto my end, I feared; and ſo nigh the Treaſure, I reioyced: Death affrighted me, the Treaſure delighted me. To ſhun that, ſince I could not enioy this, I rent off from my backe the ragges that the Squire my Maſter had left me, for the good ſeruices which I had done him, and began to ſwimme (though I had but very little skill therein) Neceſſitie giuing Wings to my feet, and Oares to my hands. I know not how; a Cord faſtened about my foot, which (as farre as I could perceiue) was tyed to a great Cheſt (without doubt, full of Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els) which, though I could, I would not vnlooſen; imagining, whether
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:5419:19"/> my former thoughts might not haue beene ſome prophecie. But ſuch was my bad lucke, that if all the prophecies in the World had promiſed me ſome happy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant fortune, yet none of them had come to paſſe. As the Cord leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened, my hopes and ambition encreaſed, beleeuing, that if I could but come a ſhoare with it, I would draw and pull out of the Sea that great Cheſt, wherewith <hi>Lazaro</hi> ſhould be more wealthy, and more reſpected, then <hi>Preſter Iohn</hi> of the <hi>Indies.</hi> The Fiſhes which were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout mee, came to bite mee, thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting mee forward with their bobs, which were to mee as a Stirrop: And ſo they iogging, and I kic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, wee came almoſt to the top of the Water, where there befell mee a chance, which was cauſe of all my misfortune. The Fiſhes and I ranne into a Net, which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:5419:19"/> certaine Fiſhermen had caſt forth: who feeling a Draught, drew it vp with ſuch violence (and the Water with no leſſe, beginning to enter into mee) that vnable to reſiſt, I began to drowne, and could not haue eſcaped, if the Saylers (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their accuſtomed haſte) had not drawne vp the prey into their Boat. The Diuell take that filthie ſauour: in all my life time I neuer drunke worſe ſtuffe; it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted ſomewhat like the Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Arch-Prieſt his Piſſe, which once my Wife made mee drinke, telling mee it was Wine of <hi>Oca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi>

                     <hi>Ocana,</hi> a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in <hi>Spaine,</hi> where very good Wine is made.</note> Hauing put into the Boat the Fiſhes, and I among them, they began to draw the Cord, by the which (as it is ſayd) they pulled vp the bottome: they found mee tyed at it; whereat much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, they ſayd, What Fiſh is this, that hath the face of a man?
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:5419:20"/> Is it not ſome Diuell, or ſome Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? But let vs draw this Rope, and ſee what Clogge hangs at the heeles. Then fell they a haling and tugging, with ſuch might &amp; maine, that they had like to haue ſunke the Boat: Perceiuing the danger, they preſently cut the Rope, and with it, the hopes of <hi>Lazaro</hi> of euer attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">The <hi>Gothes</hi> were the firſt Kings of <hi>Spaine,</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence, when a man is termed rich and great, hee is ſaid to be of the <hi>Gothes.</hi>
                  </note> to the greatneſſe of the <hi>Gothes.</hi> They held my head downe-ward, that I might the better caſt out the Water, as alſo the Wine, which I had drunke. They perceiued, that I was not dead (which had not beene the worſt for me) and gaue me a little Wine, with the which (as a Lampe with Oyle) I came againe to my ſelfe. They asked mee a hundred Queſtions, but I anſwered to done of them, vntill ſuch time as they gaue mee ſome Meate. Then recouering breath, the firſt thing that I asked
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:5419:20"/> them, was for the Clogge which I dragged at my foot: They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered mee, that they had cut it, to ſaue themſelues from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger wherein they were. There did <hi>Troy</hi> looſe her ſelfe, and <hi>Lazaro</hi> his well-placed deſires: there began his paines, griefes, and torments. There is no greater vexation in the World, then to haue beene rich, and eleuated to the Hornes of the Moone; and afterward, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come poore, and ſubiect to fooles. All my <hi>Chimera's</hi> were built vpon the Water; and in an inſtant, it drowned them all. Then did I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late vnto the Fiſhermen, what both they and I had loſt, by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off my Ieſſes: which, when they vnderſtood, they were ſo grieued, that one of them had like to runne madde. But one of the graueſt among them ſayd, That it would be good to turne
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:5419:21"/> mee againe into the Sea, and to ſtay there for mee, vntill I came forth againe. They were all of his opinion; and, notwithſtanding all the inconueniences which I repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented vnto them, they perſiſted in their deliberation, ſaying, That ſince I knew the way, it would bee an eaſie thing for mee (as if it had beene no more, then to goe to a Cookes Shop, or to a Tauerne.) They were ſo blinded with couetouſneſſe, that alreadie they would haue throwne mee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer boord; if my good, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bad fortune, had not brought to the place where wee were, another Boat, which came to carry away their Draught. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they held their peace, left the others ſhould know of the Treaſure which they had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, and were conſtrained for that time, to deſiſt from their
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:5419:21"/> cruell intention. They brought their Boates to the Shore, and craftily threw mee among the Fiſhes, with intent to returne to ſeeke mee againe, when conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently they might. Then two of them tooke mee, and ſecretly carryed mee to a little Cottage, not farre from thence. One that knew not the myſterie, asked them what was that? They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That it was a Monſter which they had taken with the Tunnies. When I ſaw my ſelfe in the Lodge, I deſired them to giue mee ſome ragges, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to couer my nakedneſſe, that I might ſhew my ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men. That ſhall bee (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered they) when the Recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is made with the Hoſteſſe; but I vnderſtood not (at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) that kinde of language. The fame of the Monſter did
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:5419:22"/> ſpread it ſelfe throughout all the Countrey, ſo that much people came to the Cottage, for to ſee mee: But the Fiſhermen would not ſhew mee, ſaying, That they expected a Licence from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and Inquiſitors to that end; vntill when, they deſired to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed. I was amazed, not knowing what to ſay, or doe, little imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning what their intention was. It was with mee as with Cuckolds, who are the laſt that know, that they are ſuch. Theſe Diuels found out an Inuention, the Diuell him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe could not haue inuented the like; which requireth a new Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and new attention.</p>

For perceiuing that ſo great number of people came to ſee the new Fiſh, they determined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence themſelues of the loſſe that they had made, in cutting the Rope from my foot: and therefore they ſent to demaund a Licence of the Inquiſitors, to ſhew ouer all <hi>Spaine</hi> a Fiſh, that had a mans face. They obtained it very eaſily, by meanes of a Preſent which they made to their Lordſhips, of the beſt fiſh they had taken. When then the good <hi>Lazaro</hi> was giuing thanks

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:5419:23"/> am verily perſwaded, that no Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene, Baziliske, Viper, or Lioneſſe with Whelpes, is more cruell then thou art. Thou rayſeſt men by thy flatteries, and cheriſhings, to the higheſt of thy delights, and riches, and from thence doeſt hurle them headlong into the depth of all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and calamities, by ſo much the greater, by how much thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours haue beene great. One of theſe my Tormentors hearing my complaint, with a Carter-like voyce ſaid to me, If Maſter Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſpeakes but a word more, hee ſhall preſently bee ſalted with his companions, or bee burned for a Monſter: The Lords of the Inquiſition (continued hee) haue ordayned, that wee carrie him thorow all the Cities and Places of <hi>Spaine,</hi> to make him bee ſeene of all men, as a Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, and Monſter of Nature.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:5419:24"/> I ſwore and vowed vnto them, that I was neyther Tunnie, Monſter, nor any ſuch thing, but as good a man as any Neighbours Child whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer: and that if I was come out of the Sea, it was by reaſon I had fallen into it, among thoſe that were drowned, going to the Warres of <hi>Argters.</hi> But they were deafe; and ſo much the more, that they were not minded to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand mee. Seeing that my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were as vainely ſpent, as Suddes about an Aſſes face; I put on pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, expecting till Time, that procureth all, ſhould cure my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, proceeding from thoſe cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Metamorphoſis. They put mee in a halfe Tubbe, made after the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of a Brigantine, full of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſo that ſitting in it, it came vp to my Lippes. I could not ſtand vpon my feet, for they were tyed with a Rope, whereof one end came
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:5419:24"/> out through a Leaden Pipe, put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the hoopes and boards of the ſaid Tub, in ſuch ſort, that if by miſchance I grunted neuer ſo little, in pulling onely the Rope, they made me plunge (like a Duck) and drinke more Water then one that hath the Dropſie. I ſhut my mouth cloſe, till ſuch time as hee that pulled the Rope, had ſlackned it; and then I peeped out with my head like a Tortoyſe, learning from thence-forth by my owne harme to be warie. Being layd in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, they ſhewed me to euery one: and the number of thoſe that came to ſee mee, was ſo great, that in one day (euery one paying three halfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence) they got two hundred Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als. <note place="margin">That is, fiue pound.</note> The more they gayned, the more they coueted; which made them haue a great care of my wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. They entred in conſultation, whether it were beſt euery night to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:5419:25"/> take me out of the Water, leaſt the ouer-much moiſtneſſe and cold might ſhorten my life, which was dearer vnto them then their owne, for the profit which they receiued by it. At length they concluded, that I ſhould ſtill remaine therein; perſwading themſelues, that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome would turne into nature: ſo that by that meanes, poore <hi>Lazaro</hi> was as greene Rice, or Hempe in a ſtanding Poole. I leaue to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable conſideration of the gentle Reader, what in ſuch a caſe I might endure, ſeeing my ſelfe detained in ſo ſtrange a kind of Priſon; a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue in a Land of freedome, and fettered by the malice of thoſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous Puppet-players; and (which was worſt, and plagued mee moſt) was to be forced to counterfeit the dumbe man, without being ſo; nor to haue power ſo much as to open my mouth, becauſe that at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:5419:25"/> that I did open it, my Centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell was ſo watchfull, that (without being diſcouered by any one) hee would ſtop it with Water, for feare leaſt I ſhould ſpeake. My meat was ſoaked Bread, which thoſe that came there, threw mee, to ſee mee eate: ſo, that in the ſpace of ſixe moneths that I remained in that Bath, the Deuill a bit of any thing elſe that I did eate, being readie to die for hunger. My drinke was the Water of the Tubbe; which not being very cleane, was the more ſubſtantiall: for the coldneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of gaue me a Laske, which laſted as long as I continued in that watrie Purgatorie.</p>

               <p>THeſe Extortioners carryed mee from Citie to Citie, from Towne to Towne, and from Farme to Farme, more jocund with their gaine, then the Earth with May flowers; and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting poore <hi>Lazaro,</hi> thus did ſing:</p>
               <l>Long life and health God graunt vnto the Fiſh,</l>
               <l>Who (without working) doth maintaine our Diſh.</l>
               <p>The Hearſe wherein I was, was carryed vpon a Cart, and attended by three; the Car-man; hee that drew the Cord when I did offer to ſpeake; and hee that related my life: who likewiſe made the ſpeeches, telling the ſtrange meanes they had
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:5419:26"/> vſed to catch mee, and lying more confidently, then any Taylor vpon an Eaſter Eue. When wee trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led through inhabited places, they ſuffered me to ſpeake; which was the greateſt courteſie I receiued of them. I asked them, what Deuill had put it into their heads, to carry me vp and downe after ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in a Tubbe. They anſwered me, That if they had not done ſo, I would haue died preſently; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as I was) a Fiſh, they knew I could not liue out of the Water. Seeing them ſo confident, I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to be one; and ſo I perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my ſelfe, ſince that euery one eſteemed me ſo; beleeuing, that the Sea-Water might haue transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med mee (the voyce of the People being, according to the Prouerbe, the voyce of God) ſo that from thence-forward I was as ſilent as if I had been at Maſſe. They brought
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:5419:27"/> me to the Court; where their gaine was great, the followers thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very deſirous of nouelties, as men that liue in perpetuall idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Among many that came to ſee mee, there were two Schollers, who conſidering more exactly my Phyſiognomie, ſaid in a low voice, That they durſt ſweare vpon a Booke, that I was no Fiſh, but a Man; and that if they had beene in any charge of Iuſtice, they would haue ſifted out the naked truth, with a Whip on their naked ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. I prayed to God in my mind that they would doe it, ſo that I might haue beene freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence: and thereupon I thought to helpe them forwards, ſaying, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Schollers are in the right. But ſcarce had I opened my mouth, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my Centinell had popped it vnder Water. The ſhouting that all the people kept when I ducked my ſelf
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:5419:27"/> (or rather they ducked me) hindred the good Licentiates to proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further in their diſcourſe. They threw me Bread, and I gobled it vp before it could be through wet; but they gaue me not halfe ſo much as I could haue eaten. Then I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred the plenty that I had in <hi>Toledo,</hi> &amp; my good friends the <hi>Germans,</hi> and what good wine I was wont to cry; beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching God not to ſuffer me to die by water, my greateſt enemy. After that I entred into conſideration of what the ſtudents had ſaid, which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the noiſe, no body had vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, &amp; confirmed my ſelfe in the opinion that I was a man, and from thence-forward I held my ſelfe to be one, although my Wife had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes told me that I was a Beaſt; &amp; the Boyes of <hi>Toledo</hi> were wont to ſay vnto me, Good M. <hi>Lazaro</hi> pull your Hat downe lower vpon your forhead, for one may ſee your horns:
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:5419:28"/> and their carrying of mee thus in pickle, had made mee doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I were a perfect man, or no. But as ſoone as I heard theſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and quick-ſighted Ouerſeers ſpeake, I made no more doubt of it, but ſought meanes to free my ſelfe from the hands of thoſe <hi>Chaldeans.</hi> One Night, in the deadeſt time, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Guards faſt aſleepe, I tryed to vnbinde my ſelfe: but by reaſon that the Cords were wet, it was impoſſible for mee. I thought to crie out, but I conſidered, that it would auayle mee nothing, for the firſt of them that ſhould heare mee, would haue ſtopped my mouth with a pottle of Water. Seeing this Gate ſhut to my remedie, with great impatience I began to tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and wallow in my mire, and at length, with my toſſing and ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, I ouerthrew the Tub, and my ſelfe withall, ſpilling all the Water.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:5419:28"/> When I ſaw my ſelfe free, I began to call out for helpe. The Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men awaking, all amazed to ſee what I had done, came in haſte to relieue me, by ſtopping my mouth, and cramming it with Graſſe: and the better to confound my excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, they likewiſe with a low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſtraine fell a crying, helpe, help; and amidſt this hurly-burly, they ran to a Well hard by, and with an incredible diligence filled vp the Tub againe. The Hoſt came forth with a Halberd, and all thoſe of the houſe, ſome with Spits, and ſome with Poles. The neighbours came running in, and a Baylife with his aſſociates, that were paſſing that way. The Inne-keeper asked the Saylers what the matter was, who anſwered, that Theeues would haue ſtollen away their Fiſh; which hee hearing (as if he had been mad) fell a crying out, Theeues, Theeues.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:5419:29"/> Some watched if they would ſteale out at the doore; others looked, if they did not climbe from one houſe to another: but already my Keepers had returned me into my Bath. It happened, that the Water which had beene ſpilled, ranne all through a hole into a lower Chamber, vpon the Bed where the daughter of the houſe did lye, who mooued with charitie, had affoorded part of it to a Prieſt, who for her ſake was come to lodge there that Night. They were ſo skared with the deluge of Water that fell vpon their Bed, and with the out-cryes and noyſe that euery one did make; that, not knowing what ſhift to make, they threw themſelues out at a window, as naked as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue.</hi> Now did the Moone ſhine ſo bright, that ſhe might haue entred in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with him from whom ſhe doth receiue her brightneſſe. As ſoone
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:5419:29"/> as they ſaw them, they cryed out, There be the Theeues, ſtoppe the Theeues. The Baylife and his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants ran after them, &amp; ouertooke them not farre from thence (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that being bare-footed, the ſtones did hinder their ſpeed) and without any delay carryed them to Priſon. The Fiſhermen the next morning very early tooke leaue of <hi>Madrid</hi> to goe to <hi>Toledo,</hi> not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what was become of the kind-hearted Wench, and the deuout Prieſt.</p>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:5419:30"/> and guide them. My labour ſerued onely to encreaſe the care and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude of my Iaylors; who angry for their laſt nights Alarum, gaue mee ſo many Baſtonadoes by the way, that they left mee almoſt for dead, ſaying, Accurſed Fiſh, would you haue beene gone? Doe you not acknowledge the great good one doth you, in not killing you? you are as the Oake, that yeeldeth not his fruit without cudgelling. After this manner bruiſed, vpbraided, and almoſt dead for hunger, they entred me into <hi>Toledo,</hi> and lodged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues hard by a place called the <hi>Zocedober,</hi> at a Widowes Houſe, whoſe Wine I was wont to crie. They put mee in a lower Roome, where a multitude of people came to ſee me, and among others, my <hi>Eluira,</hi> holding my daughter by the hand. When I ſaw them, I could not but giue way to two Niles of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:5419:30"/> teares, that guſhed out of mine eyes. I wept, and ſighed, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my ſelfe, for feare they ſhould depriue me of what I ſo much lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and of the ſight of that, which I deſired to haue a thouſand eyes to ſee, though it had beene better, that thoſe who hindred my ſpeech, had alſo taken from me my viſible facultie. For looking earneſtly vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Wife, I ſaw her (I know not if I may ſpeake it) I ſaw her with a belly mounted to her mouth. I was amazed and aſtoniſhed, although (had I been in my right wits) I had had no great cauſe, for the Arch-Prieſt my Maſter had told mee, when I went to the Warres, that hee would deale with her as if ſhee had been his owne. But what moſt vexed me, was, that I could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelfe that ſhee was with child by mee, hauing beene abſent aboue a yeere. Indeed when I dwelt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:5419:31"/> with her, and that wee were at Bed and Board together, and that ſhee would ſay to mee; <hi>Lazaro,</hi> doe not beleeue that I am falſe to thee; for ſo doing, thou doeſt wondrous ill: I was ſo well ſatisfied, that I abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to conceiue an euill thought of her, euen as the Deuill doth holy-Water; I liued jouiall, content, and without Iealouſie, the Diſeaſe of Fooles. I haue oftentimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered with my ſelfe, that this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Children doth chiefely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in imagination: for how many are there, that loue ſuch as they thinke to be theirs, who indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them no otherwiſe, then by name and number? and others, who (for certaine <hi>Chymera's</hi> forged in their braines, that their Wiues haue grafted vpon their heads the puniſhment of <hi>Acteons</hi> temeritie) doe hate and abhorre thoſe that be their owne? I began to reckon
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:5419:31"/> the moneths, and dayes, but I found the way ſtopt, to my comfort. I thought, whether my deare bed-fellow were not ſicke of the Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; but that pious imagination laſted mee but very little: for, as ſoone as ſhee was gone forth, two old Goſſips began to ſay one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, What thinke you of the Arch-Prieſtreſſe? ſhee hath no want of her Husband. Who hath got her with Child, asked the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Who? replyed the firſt: Marry, the reuerend Arch-Prieſt; who is ſo good, that (for to giue no ſcandall, if ſhee ſhould be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in his houſe without hauing a Husband) hee doth marry her the next Sunday to <hi>Peter Gabacho,</hi> who will bee as patient as my Goſſip <hi>Lazaro.</hi> That was the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and <hi>Non plus vltra</hi> of my patience; it began to ouercome my Heart: So that, ſweating
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:5419:32"/> within the Water, and vnable to helpe my ſelfe, I fell downe in a ſwoone within the Hog-ſtie. The water then entring amaine through all the paſſages, without any reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, I appeared to be dead (much againſt my will, which was, to liue as long as it would pleaſe God, and I ſhould be able, in ſpight of <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> and all croſſe fortune.) The Fiſhermen very heauie, cauſed all that were there, to goe out, and in all haſte lifted my head out of the Water; but they found, that I was without pulſe, or breath, as they themſelues were for very griefe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayling their loſſe, which to them was none of the leaſt. They tooke me out of the Tubbe, and did what they could to make me vomit that which I had ſwallowed; but all in vaine, for death (as they thought) had alreadie ſhut the doore after her. They remained blanke (as at a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:5419:32"/> running Lottery) not knowing any remedie, nor how to eaſe their griefe. It was at laſt decreed by the Councell of three, that the Night following they ſhould car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie mee to the Riuer, and ſhould there throw mee in, with a ſtone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout my necke; to make that my Graue, which had beene the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my death.</p>

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:5419:33"/> was, nor whither they carryed mee. Only I heard them ſay, It is beſt for our ſafety to ſeek out ſome Pit very deepe, that he may not be found ſo ſoone. By the thred I recouered the needle, &amp; imagining preſently what the matter was, and ſeeing that the Crow could be no blacker then his wings, hearing a noyſe of people thereabouts, I began to cry out, Helpe, help, for the Lords ſake. The ſtir which I heard, was the Watch, who came inſtantly to my out-cry with their naked ſwords, &amp; ranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Sack, found poore <hi>Lazaro</hi> through ſoaked, as a Greene-fiſh. They caried vs all, as they found vs, to the gaole; the fiſhermen weeping to ſee themſelues priſoners, and I laughing for being at libertie. They put them in a dungeon, and me in a good Bed. The next day being exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, they confeſſed, That indeed they had carryed me vp and downe

For my part, I told the whole truth, and how thoſe Raſcals held me bound, and put me into ſuch a poſture, as I was not able ſo much as to grunt. They brought in the Arch-Prieſt, and my good <hi>Elutra,</hi> to proue if it were true that I were that <hi>Lazaro de Tormes,</hi> whom I ſaid I was. My Wife en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the firſt, and earneſtly behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding me, ſaid, That the truth was, that I ſomewhat reſembled her good husband; but ſhee beleeued I was not hee: for though I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes bin a great Beaſt, I was more <note place="margin">Becauſe hee loued Wine well, as Gnats doe; and like an Oxe had Hornes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kold.</note> likely to become a Gnat or an Oxe then a Fiſh.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:5419:34"/> without doubt I was a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, which he did binde himſelfe to proue. (The Diuell I am as ſoone, (ſaid I to my ſelfe) vnleſſe ſome Conjurer now ſhould perſecute me, transforming me into what hee liſted.) The Iudges commanded him to be ſilent. Then came in the reuerend Arch-Prieſt, who ſeeing me ſo bleake, and wrimpled, like an old Wiues belly, ſaid, That he ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knew me by my face, nor ſhape. I then remembred him of ſome old paſſages, and many ſecrets that had paſſed betweene vs; particularly I bad him remember the Night that he came naked vnto my bed, ſaying, that he was afraid of a Hob-goblin that haunted his chamber, and laid himſelfe betweene my Wife &amp; me. He, for feare I ſhould haue procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded any farther in tokens, confeſſed it to be true, that I was <hi>Lazaro,</hi> his good friend and ſeruant. The Suit

They condemned euery one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to two hundred ſtripes, and their goods confiſcated, the one part to the King, the other to the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the third to <hi>Lazaro.</hi> They were found to haue two thouſand <note place="margin">Fiftie pounds.</note> Ryals, two Mules, and a Cart; of the which (all duties and charges payd) there fell to my ſhare twentie <note place="margin">A Duckat is fiue ſhillings ſix pence of our money.</note> duckats.

All the time that the twentie duckats laſted, if the King had called me Couſin, I had taken it for an affront. When wee <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> can but get a Ryall, wee are Princes; and though wee doe want it, wee doe not want preſumption.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:5419:36"/> of his, of what Kindred that Braga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docio was. Hee told mee, that his father was a treader of Grapes in Vintage time, and a Hogge-killer <note place="margin">In Spaine, and other Countries, to make their Wines, they put their grapes into great Tubs, into the which men goe bare legged and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times naked to tread the grapes, for to expreſſe the juice.</note> in Winter; and his mother a Tripe-waſher, I meane a Tripe-wife's maid. I had bought a Sute of old peeld Veluet, and a long thredbare Cloake of <hi>Segouia</hi> Serge; I wore my Sword ſo long, that the Chape vnpaued the ſtones of the ſtreetes, as I walked. When I came out of Priſon, I would not goe ſee my Wife; to giue her a greater deſire to ſee mee, and to bee reuenged of the ſcorne that ſhee had made of me. I beleeued vndoubtedly, that ſeeing me ſo well apparrelled, ſhee would repent her ſelfe, and receiue me with open armes; but obſtinate ſhee was, and obſtinate ſhee remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. I found her in Child-bed, and newly married. When ſhe ſaw me, ſhee cryed out as if ſhee had beene
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:5419:37"/> mad, Take from before me that ill watered Fiſh, that Face of a new-pluckt Gooſe; or by the bleſſedneſſe of my dead Fathers Soule, if I riſe, I will ſcratch out his eyes. I, with a great deale of flegme, anſwered her, Faire and ſoftly (good Miſtris Wagtaile) if you know me not for your Husband, nor I you for my Wife, let mee haue my daughter, and as good friends as euer before, for I haue got wherewith to marry her very honourably. Me thought thoſe twentie duckats ſhould haue beene like little <hi>Iohn</hi> of God's fiue <note place="margin">Twelue Blanckes make an Engliſh penny.</note> Blanckes; who, as ſoone as hee had ſpent them, found fiue other ſtill in his Purſe: but with mee, as I was <hi>Lazarillo</hi> of the Deuill, it fell out o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, as ſhall appeare in the next Chapter. The Arch-Prieſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed himſelfe againſt my demand, ſaying, That ſhe was not mine; and for proofe thereof, hee ſhewed mee
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:5419:37"/> the Church Booke for Chriſtnings, which compared with the Regiſter of Marriages, it appeared, that the Girle was borne foure moneths af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that I firſt carnally knew my Wife. My man <hi>Thomas</hi> fell downe, who till then had beene on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, and I perceiued the error in the which I had liued vntill that time, beleeuing her to bee my daughter, that was not ſo. I ſhaked vpon them the duſt of my ſhoes, &amp; waſhed my hands in token of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, &amp; of parting for euer, &amp; ſo I turned my back vnto them, with as much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort as if I had neuer known them. I went to ſeeke ſome of my friends, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I related the whole matter: they comforted me; which was a thing very eaſie for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to do. I would not returne to the Office of common Cryer, for my Veluet had rooted out ſuch petty thoghts. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing toward the Gate cald <hi>de Vilagra</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:5419:38"/> as I paſſed through that of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> of the Kings, I met with an old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of mine; who, after ſhe had ſaluted me, told me how that my Wife was growne more gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, ſince ſhe had vnderſtood that I had money; particularly that, that <hi>Gabacho</hi> had as good as new dreſſed her from top to toe. I deſired her to let me vnderſtand the buſineſſe: ſhe did it, ſaying, that Maſter Arch-Prieſt and my Wife had entred one day into conſultation, whether it were beſt to take me home again to them, &amp; turne out that <hi>Gabacho,</hi> bringing reaſons of the one ſide and of the other. This their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting was not ſo ſecret, but that the new Husband heard of it: who diſſembling, the next morning went out to work at the Oliue trees, whither his Wife &amp; mine at noone did goe to carry him his dinner. He then bound her faſt to a Tree, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:5419:38"/> hauing ſtripped her ſtarke-naked, gaue her there aboue a hundred ſtripes; and not content with that, made a bundle of all her Cloathes, &amp; pulling her Rings off her fingers, ranne away with all, leauing her bound, naked, and in a pittifull caſe: where (without doubt) ſhe had died if the Arch-Prieſt had not ſent to ſeeke her. She went on, ſaying, that ſhe beleeued without all peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that if I ſent but any one to entreat them, they would receiue me to them as before: for ſhee had heard my <hi>Eluira</hi> ſay, Wretched that I am, why did I not admit my good <hi>Lazaro,</hi> who was eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as good as the good Bread; not hard to pleaſe, nor ſcrupulous, who ſuffered mee to doe whatſoeuer I would? That was a touch, which turned me topſie-turuie, and made me reſolue to follow the counſell of the good old Woman: Neuertheleſſe, I
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:5419:39"/> thought good firſt to conferre of it with my friends.</p>

               <p>WE men are ſomewhat a kin to laying Hens: for if we mind to do any good, wee preſently proclaime and kackle it abroad: but if euil, we will not that any one know it, leaſt they ſhould diſſwade vs from that, from the which it were good wee ſhould be diuerted. I went to ſee one of my friends, &amp; I found three together; for ſince I had mony, they were multiplied as flies in the Fruit ſeaſon. I told them my intention and deſire, which was, to goe &amp; liue againe with my Wife, and ſhun the ſlandering ſpeeches of maleuolent tongues; a knowne euill being bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:5419:39"/> then an vnknowne good. But they made the deed ſo haynous and odious vnto me, telling me, that I was a man without either blacke in my eyes, or braines in my head, that I would goe to dwell with a Punke, a Cockatrice, a Catamountaine, &amp; laſtly, the Deuils Hackney (for ſo in <hi>Toledo</hi> doe they call Prieſts Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.) They ſaid ſuch and ſo many things to me, and ſo perſwaded me, that I determined neither to intreat her, nor to ſeeke to her. Theſe my good friends (I would the Deuill had had the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) ſeeing that their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and perſwaſions had wrought with me, proceeded farther, ſaying, That they counſelled me (becauſe I was ſo deare vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) to take away the ſpots, and cleanſe the ſtaines of my reputation; to ſticke cloſe to it, and not let it fall to the ground: And therefore that I ſhould exhibit a Complaint in Law againſt the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:5419:40"/> Arch-Prieſt and my Wife; for all ſhould coſt me neyther penny, nor farthing, they being (as they were) Officers of Iuſtice. The one (who was an Atturney for loſt Suites) of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered me a hundred duckats for my gettings. The other, as better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented (being a Sollicitor for Traders) told me, That if hee were in my Coat, he would not giue my gaines for two hundred. The third aſſured me, That (as he did well know, being, as he was, a Sergeant) hee had ſeene other Caſes, not ſo plaine, and a great deale doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler then this, that had beene worth to the vndertakers an innumerable ſumme; although he beleeued, that vpon the firſt Writ the good <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Bacchalaure</hi> would fill my hands, and greaſe theirs, that wee might giue ouer the Suit, deſiring that I would returne againe to my Wife: which would be much more hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:5419:40"/> and profitable for mee, then if I had made meanes vnto her. They ſo highly commended this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vnto mee, alluring mee with faire and great hopes, that they brought mee to what they would, not knowing how to anſwere their ſophiſticall arguments: howbeit, I know, that it was better to forgiue and humble my ſelfe, then to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute things to the extremities, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling that moſt difficult comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God, To loue our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And then, my Wife did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer behaue her ſelfe like an enemie towards me: contrariwiſe, by her I began to grow into credit, and to bee knowne of many, who would point at mee with their finger, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, There goes patient <hi>Lazaro:</hi> by her I began to haue an Office, and Benefice. If the daughter, which the Arch-Prieſt ſaid was none of mine, were ſo or no; God, who ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:5419:41"/> the reines, beſt knowes; and it may be, that as I may haue beene miſtaken, hee likewiſe may haue beene deceiued. As it may happen, that ſome one, who reading this ſimplicitie of mine, will burſt out into ſuch laughter, as hee may chance to moiſten the Linings of his Breeches; doth maintaine the children of ſome reuerend Frier; and doth labour, ſweat, and moyle, to leaue them rich, that begger him of his reputation; beleeuing for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that if there bee one honeſt Woman in the World, it is his. And moreouer, it may be, that the Pedigree whereof thou doeſt boaſt (gentle Reader) as deriued from <hi>Mars,</hi> is deducted from <hi>Vulcan.</hi> But leauing euery one in his good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, all theſe good conſiderations did not withſtand, but that I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a complaint againſt the Arch-Prieſt, and againſt my Wife: and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:5419:41"/> (hauing ready money) within foure and twentie houres they put them into Priſon; him, into the Arch-Biſhops; and her, into the common Iayle. The Lawyers did bid mee, not to regard the Money that I did lay out for that buſineſſe, by reaſon that I ſhould recouer it all againe of the <hi>Domine.</hi> So that, for to doe him more harme, and that the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges might be ſo much the greater, I gaue them whatſoeuer they did aske me. And becauſe they ſmelt my Caſh, as Bees doe Honey, they were ſo carefull and diligent to runne too and fro, not making one idle ſteppe, that in leſſe then eight dayes the Cauſe was very forward, and my Purſe very backward. The Euidences were produced with great facilitie, by reaſon that the Sergeants that had arreſted them, had taken them napping; &amp; euen as they were in their ſhirts, had caried
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:5419:42"/> them to Priſon. The witneſſes were many, and their depoſitions true. But my honeſt Atturney, Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, and Regiſter, perceiuing my Purſe to be at an ebbe, began to grow ſo careleſſe and lazie, that to haue made them aduance one ſtep, they had needed more ſpurring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any Hackney Iade. When the Arch-Prieſt and his friends vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood our great neglect, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to crow vp, and grow peart, greaſing the hands and feet of their Agents; being like the weights of a Clock, which doe mount propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally as the others goe downe. They took ſuch a courſe, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a fortnight after they came out of Priſon vpon Bayle; and within leſſe then a weeke more, by meanes of falſe witneſſes, they made poore <hi>Lazaro</hi> be condemned to aske par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, pay all charges, and to bee ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht for euer out of <hi>Toledo.</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:5419:42"/> pardon, as it was moſt iuſt hee ſhould, who with twentie crownes had vndertaken to plead againſt him that meaſured them by Pecks. I gaue all to my very ſhirt to helpe to pay the charges, going out with my bare skin to my ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. I ſaw my ſelfe in one inſtant, rich, at Law with one of the Powers of the holy Church of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo</hi> (an enterpriſe only for a Prince) reſpected of my Friends, feared of mine Enemies, and in the predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Gentleman, that would not ſuffer an affront; and in the ſame inſtant I found my ſelfe caſt (not out of the Earthly Paradiſe, my priuat nakedneſſe obumbrated with Figge-leaues, but) out of the place which I moſt loued and eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; where I had receiued ſo much good entertainment, ſo many plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. My Nuditie being couered with certaine Rags which I found
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:5419:43"/> vpon a Dunghill, I betooke mee to the common comfort of the diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; beleeuing, that ſince I was at the loweſt of Fortunes Wheele, neceſſarily (at her turning) I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to riſe. At that time I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred what once I had heard my Maſter the Blind-man ſay, (who, when hee did ſet himſelfe a preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, would doe wonders) That all the men in the World did aſcend &amp; deſcend by the Wheele of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; ſome following her motion, others going againſt it: this onely difference being betweene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; that thoſe that went with the ſtreame, with the ſame ſwiftneſſe that they did climbe vp, with the ſame they doe tumble downe: and thoſe that goe againſt it, if once they attained vnto the top (though with great paines and labour) they maintained themſelues there a long time. I, like the former, did run the ſmooth way
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:5419:43"/> of her Wheele, but with ſuch ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that I ſcarce yet was come to the top, when ſhe threw me into the bottomeleſſe pit of all calamities. I ſaw my ſelfe a Beggar, euen of the moſt beggarly, hauing vntill then beene one of a better ſtampe; and might well haue ſaid, Naked did I come into the World, and naked doe I goe out, I neyther winne nor looſe. In this pickle I took my way towards <hi>Madrid,</hi> crauing the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table beneuolence of well diſpoſed perſons, as one that beſt could do it; for I was a Miller: to which Trade, I, to returne, by need was made. I made my moane to euery one: ſome did pittie mee, others did laugh at mee, and others did giue mee their almes; ſo that hauing neyther Wife nor daughter to maintain, I had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten meat &amp; drink to ſpare. That yere ſuch ſtore of wine had bin gathered, that almoſt at euery dore I came to,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:5419:44"/> they would aske mee if I would drinke, becauſe they had no Bread to giue me; I neuer refuſed it: ſo that ſometimes it hath beene my chance, before breake-faſt, to haue gulped vp foure pottles of Wine, wherewith I was more jocund and merry then Schoole-Boyes vpon a holy-day Eue. If I may ſpeak what I thinke, the Beggars life is the only life; all the others doe not deſerue that name. If rich men had but tryed it, they would forſake their riches for it, as the ancient Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers did; who, for to enioy it, left what they poſſeſſed; I ſay, for to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy it: for the Philoſophers life and the Beggars is all one; onely they are diſtinguiſhed, in that the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers did forſake what they had for the loue of it; and the Beggars without forſaking any thing, doe finde it. They did deſpiſe their wealth, that with leſſe impediments
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:5419:44"/> they might contemplate both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and diuine things, with the Celeſtiall motions: Theſe, that they may (vncurbed) runne through the fields of their looſe appetites. They did caſt their goods into the Sea; theſe doe bury them in their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes. They did deſpiſe them as periſhable and tranſitorie things; theſe do not eſteeme them, becauſe they carry with them care and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, things altogether out of their element. So that the Beggars life is quieter then that of either King, Emperour, or Pope. In it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did I meane to walke, as in a way moſt free, leſſe dangerous, and very delightfull.</p>

               <p>THere is no Trade, Science, nor Art, but, to attayne to the perfection thereof, it is needfull to imploy the capacitie of the beſt vnderſtanding in the world. You ſhall haue a Shooma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, that hath been thirtie yeeres at his Trade, if you did him make you a paire of ſhooes broad at the toes, high of inſtep, neate, and without puckering; doe you thinke hee will doe it? before he make you a paire ſuch as you deſire, hee will ſpoyle your foot. Aske a Philoſopher, why Flyes vpon a white thing doe mute black, and contrariwiſe, vpon a black, white; and you will make him bluſh, like a Maid vpon her Marriage night, not knowing how
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:5419:45"/> to anſwer; or if hee doe to this, hee will not to a thouſand other foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. It was my chance to meete, neere to <hi>Meſcas,</hi> an Arch-Rogue, <note place="margin">Meſcas, a Citie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid and Toledo.</note> and by his countenance perceiuing what he was, I paced towards him as to an Oracle, to enquire of him how I might gouerne my ſelfe in my new life, without bringing my ſelfe within the compaſſe of the Law. Hee anſwered me, That if I meant cleanely to come off, and without danger, his counſell was, that I ſhould ioyne to the life of an Hypocrite; that is to ſay, that though I were a Rogue in profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet (not to ſeeme ſo) I ſhould giue my ſelfe to ſome imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to skullerie in a Kitchin, to cry Broomes, to ſweepe Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes, to ſcrape Trenchers, or to carry Burthens from one place to another; which would ſerue as a Buckler, to couer my Beggerie.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:5419:46"/> He told me moreouer, that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that hee had not done ſo ſince theſe twentie yeeres that he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Occupation, he had the day before receiued two hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred ſtripes as a Rogue and Vagabond. This aduiſe pleaſed me, and I followed his counſell. As ſoone as I came to <hi>Madrid,</hi> I got me a Porters Cord, with the which I quartred my ſelfe in the midſt of the Market place with more content then a ſtarued Cat with Gibblets. And in good time, and happy houre, the firſt that did ſet me to worke, was a Maid (God forgiue me, for I lye) of ſome eighteene yeeres of age, that ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pred more then a new vayled Nun; ſhe bad me follow her, and led me through ſo many ſtreetes, that I thought ſhe had vndertaken it as a taske, or that ſhe did it to abuſe me: at length wee came to a houſe, which, by the Wicket thereof, great
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:5419:46"/> Court, and the Wenches that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced there, I knew to be the publike Brothell. Then did ſhee bring me into her Cell; where ſhe asked me, if I would be payed for my paines before wee went out: I anſwered her, that there was no haſte, vntill wee came to the place where I was to carry my burthen, which I tooke vp, and ſet forward to the Gate of <hi>Guadalachara,</hi> where ſhee told me ſhee was to take Waggon, to goe to the Faire of <hi>Nagera.</hi> The Fardle <note place="margin">A Citie in Spaine.</note> was light, moſt part thereof being nothing but little Sawcers, Bottles with Painting, and Waters. As wee went, I vnderſtood how ſhee had beene eight yeeres of that Trade. The firſt that did ſet mee abroach (ſaid ſhee) was the Father Rector of the Ieſuits of <hi>Seuil,</hi> where <note place="margin">A Citie in Spaine.</note> I was borne; who did it with ſo great deuotion, that from that day to this, I haue beene very deuout.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:5419:47"/> Hee recommended mee to one of the holy Women, deuoted to their <note place="margin">Thoſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are called Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae.</note> Order, with whom I remained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue ſix moneths, well prouided of all things neceſſarie. I was drawne thence by a Captaine, and ſo haue roued vp and down from one place to another, &amp; am where thou ſeeſt. And would to God I had neuer departed out of the protection of that good Father, who entertained me as his Daughter, and loued me as his Siſter. Finally, I haue beene conſtrained to follow an Occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to get my liuing. With this diſcourſe we came to the waggon, which was ready to ſet forth. I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged my Burden into it, &amp; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her to pay me for my labor, the Rag-taile anſwered, That I wil very willingly; and with that, lifting vp her hand, ſhe gaue me ſuch a Boxe on the eare, that ſhee felled me to the ground, ſaying, Art thou ſuch
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:5419:47"/> an Aſſe, as to aske Money of one of my Profeſſion? Did I not bid thee, before thou cameſt out of the houſe of Fellowſhip, to pay thy ſelfe, if thou wouldſt, vpon me? With that (as nimbly as a Graſſe-hopper) ſhee leaped into the Waggon, and away ſhe went, and left me fretted at the heart, and as blancke as a Bell-foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, not knowing what ayled me; only I conſidered with my ſelf, that if the progreſſe of my new Trade did follow the beginning, I ſhould thriue fairly at the yeres end. Vpon my departure thence, there came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Waggon from <hi>Alcala de He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nares;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A Citie in Spaine.</note> out of the which, the paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers (who were all Whores, Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and Fryers) being alighted, one of the Order of S. <hi>Francis</hi> asked me, if I would doe him that charitie, as to carry his Truſſe to his Couent, I anſwered him with cheerfulnes, that I would, for I perſwaded my ſelfe,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:5419:48"/> that hee would not couzen me, as that Drab had done: therefore I tooke it vp, and it was ſo heauie, that I could ſcarce carry it; yet for the hope of my good pay, I ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my ſelfe. Being come to the Cloyſter very weary, becauſe it was farre, the Frier tooke his Packe, and ſaying, For Gods ſake bee it done, went in, and ſhut the doore after him. I waited there vntill he ſhould come to pay me; but ſeeing that he did tarry long, I knocked at the Gate. The Porter came forth, and asked me what I would haue; I told him, My payment for the burthen which I had brought. He anſwered mee, That I ſhould goe in Gods name, for they neuer payed any thing, and ſo locked the doore, charging me to knock no more, by reaſon it was a time of ſilence; for if I did, hee would giue mee a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred lacings with his knotty girdle.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:5419:48"/> My courage was cooled. A poore man that ſtood at the Gate ſaid to me; Brother, you may well goe your way, for theſe Fathers doe handle no money, for they liue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together vpon other mens diſhes. Let them liue vpon what they can (ſaid I) they ſhall pay mee for my paines, or I will be no longer <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillo;</hi> and thereupon I fell a knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with great anger. The Lay Brother came forth with greater, and without any farther comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment gaue me ſuch a puſh, that hee threw me backward to the ground as if I had been a mellow Peare; and kneeling vpon me, he gaue me halfe a dozen ſuch punches with his knee, and as many flamms with his girdle, that he left mee all brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as if the Clock-Tower of <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſa</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A Citie in Spaine.</note> had fallen vpon mee. I lay there ſtretched aboue halfe an houre, not being able to ariſe; I
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:5419:49"/> conſidered my euill fortune, and the ſtrength of that irregular Frier ſo ill imployed, which had been fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſerue the King our Lord and Maſter, then to deuoure the almes ordained for the poore; though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they bee ſcarce good for any employment, being idle and lazie-packs, as the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth gaue well to vnderſtand: for when the Generall of S. <hi>Francis</hi> his Order, offered two and twentie thouſand Friers to aſſiſt him in his warrs, none aboue forty, nor vnder two &amp; twenty; the inuincible Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour anſwered, That he would not haue them, by reaſon that hee ſhould haue needed euery day two and twenty thouſand fleſh-pots: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating thereby, that they are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by farre for the Kitchin, then for any labour or ſeruice.

               </head>
               <p>WEake and dead for hunger, I went little by little vp the ſtreet, &amp; paſſing through the Barly-place, I met with an old mumbler, that had more tusks then a wilde Boare, who came to me, and asked me, if I would carry a trunke for her to a friend of hers not farre from thence, &amp; ſhe would giue me foure <note place="margin">Foure quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos make a Royall, which is ſix pence.</note> quartos. I had no ſooner heard her, but I gaue God thankes, that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo filthy a mouth as hers ſhould proceede ſo ſweete a ſpeech as
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:5419:50"/> that, She would giue mee foure Quartos. I told her, Yes, with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good will; though that very good will was more to finger the fower Quartos, then to carry the burden, hauing at that time more need to be carried my ſelfe, then to carry. I tooke vp the Trunke with much adoe, by reaſon it was great and heauy: the good woman bad me carry it faire and ſoftly, becauſe that within it were bottles of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which ſhe eſteemd very much. I anſwered her, that ſhe ſhould not need to feare that, I would go ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough; for though I would haue done otherwiſe, it had been impoſſible for me, being ſo hungry that hardly I could put one foote before another. We came at length to the houſe where wee did carry the Trunke, the which they verie gladlie receiued, eſpecially a young Gentlewoman, plumpe and round
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:5419:50"/> faced (would all the cattell of my bed were ſuch, my belly being full) who with a chearefull countenance ſaid, that ſhe would keepe it in her Cloſet. I carried it thither, and the old Woman gaue her the Key of it, deſiring her to keepe it vntill ſhe returned from <hi>Segouia,</hi> where ſhee <note place="margin">A Citie in Spaine.</note> was going to viſite a Kinſwoman of hers, hoping to come backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine within fower dayes. Then embracing her, ſhee tooke leaue of her, whiſpering her in the eare I know not what, which made the Damſell bluſh like a roſe; (and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I then did like her very well, I ſhould haue liked her farre better, had the vacuity of my guts been ſtuffed with good prouender) ſhe tooke likewiſe leaue of all thoſe of the houſe, deſiring the Father and Mother of the Mayde to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe her boldnes and importunity; who told her, that their houſe was
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:5419:51"/> at her command. Shee gaue mee fower Quartos; bidding mee in mine eare the next morning verie early to come to her houſe, and ſhe would make mee earne as much more. I departed more iocund then a Shroue-tueſday, or a Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſommers Eue. I ſupped with three of them, keeping one to pay for my lodging. I then fell to conſider the power and vertue of money; for at the inſtant that the old woman had giuen mee thoſe few Quartos, I found my ſelfe lighter then the wind, more valiant then <hi>Hector,</hi> &amp; ſtronger then <hi>Hercules.</hi> O Money, it is not without reaſon that moſt men doe hold thee for their God! thou art the cauſe of all good, and the procurer alſo of all euill. Thou art the inuenter of all Arts, and the maintainer of them in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. For thee are Sciences had in eſtimation, and with thee are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:5419:51"/> defended. By thee cities are ſortified, and againe by thee their ſtrong towers are made leuell with the ground. By thee are kingdoms eſtabliſhed, and by thee in the ſame inſtant ouerthrowne. Thou art the vpholder of vertue, and againe the deſtroyer thereof. By thee Ladies do maintaine themſelues chaſte, &amp; by thee many that are ſo, become others. Laſtly, there is nothing in the world, be it neuer ſo hard, but to thee is eaſie; nothing ſo hidden, but thou canſt penetrate; no hill ſo lofty, but thou canſt pull downe; no dale ſo low, but thou canſt eleuate. The next morning I went to the old Womans houſe, according as ſhee had appointed mee, who bad mee goe with her to fetch againe the Trunke which I had carried the day before. Beeing come to the houſe, ſhee told the Maſter and Miſtris, that ſhe came
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:5419:52"/> for her Trunke, by reaſon that vpon the way to <hi>Segouia</hi> (about a mile from <hi>Madrid)</hi> ſhee had met with her Kinſwoman, who came with the ſame intention (that ſhee went) to ſee her, and that therefore ſhee did need it inſtantly, to haue out ſome cleane linnen that was in it, to giue her entertainement. The Mayde of a new ſtampe returned her the Key, kiſſing and embracing her with more affection then at the firſt time; and after ſhee had whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered her againe in the eare, they helped vp with the Trunke, which ſeemed vnto me farre lighter then the day before, becauſe my bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie was better prouided. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming downe the ſtaires, it was my chance to meete with I know not what ſtumbling block, which I thinke the Deuill of purpoſe had layde in my way, that made mee ſtumble and tumbled downe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:5419:52"/> Trunke and all to the bottome of the ſtayres, where ſtood the Father and the Mother of the ſimple and kind-hearted Wench. I broke my Noſe and ſhort Ribs with the fall, and the damned Trunke, with the Knocks and Ioults flew open. In it there appeared a young Gallant, without his Cloake, his Rapier and Dagger at his ſide, in a greene Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Sute, with a feather of the ſame colour, a paire of Carnation Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters &amp; Roſes, Crimſon Silke Stoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, and white open Shooes: who riſing vp very mannerly, &amp; making a low reuerence, ſtraight went out of doores. They were ſo amazed with that ſuddain Viſion, that they looked one vpon another like ſo many Matachines or Antickes. But when they were come to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, they called in all haſte two ſonnes that they had, &amp; with great ſtorming, declared the matter vnto
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:5419:53"/> them: Who preſently taking their Swords, and crying, Kill, Kill, went out to ſeeke the young Mad-cap. But hee had poſted away in ſuch haſte, that it was impoſſible for them to ouertake him. The Father and Mother (who all this while had remained below ſtayres) ſhutting the doores faſt, went vp, thinking to reuenge themſelues vpon the Baud: but ſhee that had heard the noyſe, and knowne the cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, had alreadie with her Scholler in the O. Q. P. taken the ayre at a backe-doore. When they found themſelues gulld, and preuented, they came down and let flye at me, I being ſo ſore, and bruiſed, that I could not ſtirre; for otherwiſe I had waited vpon him, for whoſe ſake I was ſo ill handled. The two bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers returned ſweating, and out of breath, ſwearing and vowing, That ſince they had not ouertake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:5419:53"/> they would kil their ſiſter and the Baud. But when they were told, that they had made an eſcape at the Back-ſide, then they fell a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, curſing, &amp; ſwearing. The one ſaid, Why do I not meet now with the Deuill himſelfe, with an infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Crue, that I might make ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uock of them as of ſo many Flyes? Come Deuill, Come. But now that I call thee, it is certaine, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer thou art, thou doeſt feare my anger, &amp; dareſt not appeare before me. O had I but ſeen that Coward, with my very breath I had carryed him ſo far, as no body ſhould euer haue heard any newes of him. The other went on, ſaying, Had I but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertaken him, I would not haue left one piece of him ſo big as his eare: but if he be in the world, nay, thogh he be not, he ſhall not eſcape out of my hands; for I would plough him vp, were he bid in the Centre of the Earth.</p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:5419:54"/>
               <p> Theſe and ſuch like brags &amp; threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings did they thunder out, whileſt poore <hi>Lazaro</hi> was expecting that all the ſtorme ſhould light vpon him; but yet I ſtood in more feare of ten or twelue Boyes that were there then of thoſe Braggadillos. In the end, both great and ſmall in a cluſter fell vpon my Iacket; the one kicked me, the other thumped me; ſome pulled me by the haires, others boxed me about the eares. My feare was not vaine: for the Boyes thruſted great Pinnes into my Buttocks vp to the head, which made me skreeke vnto the heauens; the ſlaues did ſo pinch me, that they made me at noone-day ſee a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Starres. Some ſaid, let vs kill him; others, It is better to throw him in the Priuy. The hammering of mee was ſuch, that they ſeemed Thraſhers in a Barne, or Hammers of a Fulling-Mill, by reaſon of the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:5419:54"/> perpetuall motion. At length fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mee breathleſſe, they deſiſted from beating, but not from threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning me. The Father as moſt ripe, or moſt rotten, commanded them to let me alone; and that if I would tell them truly who was the robber of their honour, they ſhould not do me any more harme: but I could not ſatisfie their deſire, becauſe I knew not who he was, hauing neuer ſeene him before hee came out of the Trunke. Seeing that I anſwered them nothing, they began anew to torment me. There was the way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, there the weeping for my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap; there was the ſighing, there was the curſing of my croſſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. But when I perceiued, that continually they found new wayes to perſecute me, I prayed them as well as I could to forbeare me, and that I would tell them all the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. They did ſo; and I told
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:5419:55"/> them without any omiſſion, what had paſſed; but they would giue no credit to the truth. Feeling the ſtorme to continue, I determined to couzen them, if it were poſſible, and therefore I promiſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them, who the Malefactor was; whereupon they left thraſhing of mee, promiſing mee wonders. They asked me his name, &amp; where hee liued. I anſwered, that I knew it not; and leſſe, that of the Street wherein he dwelt: but that, if they would carry me (for it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for me to goe, they had ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed me) I would ſhew them his houſe. That pleaſed them well, and therefore they gaue mee a little Wine, with the which I came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to my ſelfe: then (being well armed) two of them tooke mee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the armes, like a <hi>French</hi> Lady, and led me through <hi>Medrid.</hi> Some that did ſee mee, ſaid, They carry
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:5419:55"/> that man to Priſon; others, to the Hoſpitall: but none did hit the marke. I went amazed, and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht, not knowing eyther what to ſay, or what to doe; for I durſt not cry out for helpe, leaſt they ſhould complaine of me to the Iuſtices, whom I feared more then death it ſelfe: and to runne away, was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, not onely by reaſon of my former ill vſage, but alſo for being betweene the Father, Sonnes, and Kinsfolkes, who for that purpoſe had joyned themſelues, eight or nine together, armed at all points, like ſo many S. <hi>Georges.</hi> We croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed many Streets, and went through many Lanes, not knowing where I was, or whither I did leade them. At length wee came to the Sunne-Gate, and downe a Street right ouer-againſt it, I perceiued a Gallant that came tripping it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the toes, his Cloake jerked
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:5419:56"/> vnder one arme, a peece of a Gloue in one hand, and a Gillyflower in the other, his arme keeping time with his foot, ſo that one would haue taken him for the couſin ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane of the Duke of <hi>Infantado:</hi> hee made a thouſand ſeuerall faces and odde countenances. I knew him at the inſtant to be the Squire my Maſter, who had ſtollen away my Cloathes at <hi>Murcia:</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, ſome Saint or other (for I had not left one vnprayed to in all the Letanie) had brought him thither for my redemption. As I ſaw the occaſion offer it ſelfe ſo faire, I caught hold of it by the fore-top, and with one ſtone I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to kill two Birds, that is, to be reuenged of that bragging Cheater, and to free my ſelfe from thoſe hangmen. Which to bring to paſſe, I ſaid vnto them, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, looke about you, for yonder
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:5419:56"/> commeth the Gallant, that hath robbed you of your honour, who hath onely changed his Apparrell. They blinded with rage and anger, without any farther diſcourſe, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked mee which was hee. I pointed him out vnto them: Whereupon they ruſhed vpon him, and taking him by the Collar, threw him to the ground, where they kicked and cuffed him out of all meaſure. One of the young ſtriplings, Brother to the Gentlewoman, would haue run him through with his Sword, but that his Father hindered him; and calling Officers to their helpe, they bound him hand and foot. When I perceiued the Cards to bee thus ſhuffled, and that they were all bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, as well as I could, I began to ſhew them a faire paire of heeles, and went and hid my ſelfe. My ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Squire (who knew me) thinking they were ſome of my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:5419:57"/> that demanded my Appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, did cry out vnto them, Let me alone, Let me alone, and I will pay for two Sutes. But they ſtopped his mouth with good blowes with their fiſts; and all bloudie, bruiſed, and broken-headed, carryed him to Priſon: And I tooke my leaue of <hi>Madrid,</hi> curſing both the Occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the firſt inuentor of it.</p>

               </head>
               <p>I Was minded to put my ſelfe on my way, but I found my ſtrength farre vnequall to my courage; for which cauſe, I remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned yet ſome dayes in <hi>Madrid:</hi> which I paſſed well ynough, by reaſon, that helping my ſelfe with
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:5419:57"/> Crutches (without which I was not able to goe) I went begging from doore to doore, and from Couent to Couent, till I found my ſelfe ſtrong ynough, and able to trauell. I made the more haſte, for a thing that I heard related by a Beggar, who, with others, was lowſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the Sunne. It was the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Trunke, as already I haue told it: adding, that the man whom they had impriſoned, thinking it had beene hee of the Trunke, had prooued the contrary; for at the very inſtant that the buſineſſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he was at his Lodging, and no body thereabouts had ſeen him with other apparrell, then that wherwith they had taken him: but that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, he had bin expoſed to the publike ſhame of a Vagabond, and baniſhed <hi>Madrid.</hi> He told alſo, how the Gentlewomans friends did ſeeke for a Porter, that had dreſſed
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:5419:58"/> that Meſſe of Knauerie, ſwearing to make a Syue of his skinne with their Rapiers, if euer they met him. I opened my eyes, to preuent this accident, clapping a patch vpon one of them, and ſhauing my beard like a Monke; for I aſſured my ſelfe, that in this diſguiſe, the Mother that bare mee, could not haue knowne mee. I departed from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> with intention to goe to <hi>Teia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> to trie if (being new moulded) Fortune would miſtake me. I paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the <hi>Eſcurial,</hi> a Building which doth ſpeake the greatneſſe of the Monarch that did erect it, (for it was not yet altogether fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed) and is ſuch, that it may be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned among the Meruailes of the World; though it cannot be ſaid, that the pleaſant ſituation hath bin a motiue to build it there, the ground being very barren &amp; hilly: but well, the temperateneſſe of the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:5419:58"/> ayre; which in Summer is ſuch, that remoouing onely to the ſhade, the Heat is not troubleſome, nor the Cold offenſiue, but exceeding wholeſome. Within leſſe then two miles from thence, I met with a companie of Gipſeyes, lodged in an old decayed houſe: who, as ſoone as they perceiued me a farre off, thought I was ſome one of their Troupe, for my attire did promiſe no leſſe: but comming neerer, they ſaw their error, and were ſomewhat daunted with my preſence, becauſe (as farre as I could perceiue) they held a Conſultation, or were deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an Election. They told mee, that that was not the right way to <hi>Salamanca,</hi> but to <hi>Valledolid.</hi> See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my buſineſſe did not conſtraine me to goe rather to one place then to another; I told them, that ſince it was ſo, I would ſee that Citie, before I went into my Countrey.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:5419:59"/> One of the ancienteſt asked mee, whence I was? And vnderſtanding that I was of <hi>Teiares,</hi> he inuited me to Dinner for neighborhoods ſake, for he was of <hi>Salamanca.</hi> I accepted his offer; and afterwards they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me to relate vnto them my life, and aduentures. I did it, without any farther entreatie, as briefely as things of ſuch moment could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. When I came to ſpeake of the Tub, and what had hapned vnto me in an Inne at <hi>Madrid,</hi> I made them laugh extreamely, eſpecially two Gipſeyes, a Man and a Woman, who could ſcarce ſtand for laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I began to be aſhamed, and to bluſh, when the old Gipſey, my Countreyman, who had taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice thereof, ſaid vnto mee; Bee not out of countenance, Brother: for theſe Gentles do not laugh at your life; being ſuch, as it rather deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth admiration then laughter: of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:5419:59"/> which, ſince you haue giuen vs ſo full an account, it is reaſonable, that wee pay you in the ſame Coyne. Wherefore, reſting vpon your pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as you haue done vpon ours, if the companie will giue me leaue, I will tell you the occaſion of their laughter. Euery one anſwered, that he was well content; for they knew, that his great diſcretion &amp; experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence would not ſuffer him to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the limits of reaſon. Know then (ſaid he) that thoſe two whom you ſee yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, almoſt out of breath with laughing, are the Prieſt &amp; the Damſell, that leaped naked out at the Window, when the inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your Tub had like to haue drowned them; who (if they pleaſe) will tell you how and by what meanes they haue attayned to this ſtate of life. The Gipſey offered her ſelfe very willingly, and crauing the beneuolence of the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:5419:60"/> worthie Auditorie, with a loud, but gentle and graue voyce, ſhee thus began her owne ſtory. The day that I came out, or (to ſay better) that I leaped out of my Fathers houſe, they carryed me to Priſon, and put me in a Chamber, rather darke then cleane, and farre more ſtinking then handſome. As for the worſhipfull Maſter <hi>Vruez,</hi> who is here preſent, and may diſprooue me if I ſpeake vntruth, they clapped him vp in the Dungeon, till he told them that he was a Prieſt: wherefore they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſent him to the vnder Biſhop; who very ſharply reprehended him for hauing been ſo faint-hearted, as for a little Water to haue leaped out at a Window before all the World, and giuen ſuch a ſcandall: But with promiſe that hee made him, to be more warie and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect another time, and to doe his buſineſſe in ſuch ſort, as the ground
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:5419:60"/> it ſelfe ſhould not be priuie to his ingreſſe and egreſſe; he let him goe, enioyning him for penance, That for three dayes hee ſhould not ſing Maſſe. I remained in the cuſtodie of the chiefe Keeper or Captaine of the Priſon; who being youthfull and luſtie, and I young and not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſome, did whatſoeuer he could to pleaſe me. The Priſon to mee was a Palace, and Garden of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights. My Father and my Mother, though greatly diſpleaſed with my looſeneſſe, did what they could to ſet me looſe, but all in vaine; for the Captaine did worke all poſſible meanes to detaine mee ſtill in his keeping. In the meane time, Maſter Licentiat, here preſent, went round about the Priſon, like a ſetting Dogge, to ſee if hee could ſpeake with me: which at length hee did, by the meanes of a Baud, the beſt of her Profeſſion; who dreſſed him in
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:5419:61"/> the attyre of one of her Maids, with a Petticoat and Waſtcoat, and a Muffler before his Beard, as if hee had had the Mumpes: at this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview was the plot layd for my eſcape. The night following, there was great feaſting and reuelling at the Earle of <hi>Miranda's</hi> houſe, and in the end, the Gipſeyes were to dance; with whom <hi>Canil</hi> (for ſo is the reuerend <hi>Vruez</hi> now called) conſorted himſelfe, to haue their helpe in his pretences: which they ſo well executed (thanks to his wit and induſtrie) that we enioy both our deſired libertie, and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, that is the beſt in the world. The after-noone before the Feaſt, the Captaine kept more fidling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout me, then a Cat about a Tripe-Wife; and made me more prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations and promiſes, then a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger in a Storme at Sea: all which (as bound thereunto) I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:5419:61"/> againe with the like. He deſired me to aske him whatſoeuer I would, and hee would graunt it me, ſo it were not to be depriued of my preſence. I thanked him very much, telling him, that to want his, would be to me the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt miſchance that euer could hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen vnto me. Perceiuing I had hit the marke, I entreated him to carry me that night (ſince well he might) to the Earles houſe, to ſee the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing. This thing ſeemed very hard vnto him; neuertheleſſe, not to goe backe from his word, and becauſe the little blinde Archer had woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him with one of his Arrowes, hee did promiſe it me. Now was the High Sheriffe in loue with me, and had giuen charge to all the Guards, and to the Captaine himſelfe, to giue me good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, and to haue a care that no body ſhould carry me forth.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:5419:62"/> To conuey mee therefore more cloſely to the Reuels, hee attyred mee like a Page: my Doublet and Hoſe were of greene Damaske, layd with Gold Lace; the Cloake of Veluet, of the ſame colour, lined through with yellow Sattin; a Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net with a Herons-top and feather, and a Diamond Hat-band; a Ruffe with ſeaming Lace, and Peakes; Straw-colour Stockins; great Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Roſes, ſutable to my Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell; a paire of White Pinckt Shooes; with a gilded Rapier and Dagger, according to the faſhion. Wee came to the Banquetting-Roome, and found there a great number of Ladies and Gentlemen; the Gentlemen jouial, and in good equipage; the Ladies gallant, and beautifull: and alſo many muffled vp in their Cloakes, and Women with Veyles. <hi>Canil</hi> was dreſſed like a Roarer; and ſeeing mee, came
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:5419:62"/> ſtraightwayes on the other ſide of me; ſo that I was betweene him and the Captaine. The Reuelling began; where I ſaw things, which becauſe they belong not to what I intend to ſpeake of, I will omit. But at length, the Gipſeyes came to dance, and ſhew tricks: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on two of them grew to words, and ſo from one thing to another, the one gaue the other the Lye; who anſwered him with a ſlaſh with his Sword ouer the head, that made him bleed like an Oxe. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, that till then had thought they had beene in jeſt, began to be amazed, and to cry out, Help, help. Some Officers and Sergeants, that were there, began to beſtirre them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Euery one put his hand to his Sword, and I drew mine; but when I ſaw it naked in my hand, I fell a quiuering for very feare of it. They layed hold on the offender,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:5419:63"/> and there wanted not ſome, who (being there ſet for the purpoſe) ſaid, That the Captaine of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was there, to whoſe charge they might deliuer him. The High Sheriffe called him out, to giue him charge of the Murtherer. He would willingly haue carryed me along with him: but fearing leaſt I ſhould be knowne, hee bad me with-draw my ſelfe into a corner which hee ſhewed me, and not to ſtirre from thence, vntill hee retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. When I ſaw the Crab-lowſe had let goe his hold, I tooke my <hi>Domine Canil</hi> (who was ſtill at my elbow) by the hand, and in two ſtrides wee got out into the ſtreet, where we found one of theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who brought vs to their <hi>Rendez-vous.</hi> When the wounded man (whom alreadie euery one thought to be dead) imagined in himſelfe that we were eſcaped, hee
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:5419:63"/> roſe vp and ſaid, Gentlemen, the jeſt ſhall end here, for I am in good health; and what hath beene done, hath beene onely to make ſport to the companie. And with that, hee pulled off the Cap hee had on, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the which (vpon an Iron Skull) was an Oxes Bladder full of bloud for that purpoſe; which, with the blow that the other had giuen him, had beene broken, &amp; ſo ſpilt. Euery one fell a laughing at the jeaſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Captaine, who found it to be a troubleſome one: for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the place appointed, &amp; not finding me there, he began to ſeeke vp and downe the roome, till that asking an old Gipſey woman, if ſhe had not ſeene a Page with ſuch and ſuch toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, ſhe (that knew the whole drift) told him, Yea, and that ſhe had heard him ſay as hee went out, holding a man by the hand, Let vs goe retire our ſelues to S. <hi>Phillips.</hi>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:5419:64"/> Hee went thither in all haſte, for to ſeeke me, but to little purpoſe; for hee went towards the Eaſt, and we fled towards the Weſt. Before we left <hi>Madrid,</hi> I had changed my Cloathes for others, and had two hundred Ryals to boote: I ſold the Hat-band for foure hundred Crownes, whereof I gaue two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to theſe Gentlemen, for our entrance into their companie; for ſo had <hi>Canil</hi> couenanted with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This is the whole diſcourſe of my libertie: If Maſter <hi>Lazaro</hi> doth deſire any thing elſe, let him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and hee ſhall be ſerued, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as his worthie and jouiall preſence doth deſerue. I thanked her for her courteſie; and with as much as I was able, I tooke my leaue of them all. The good old man brought mee a mile on my way: and as we went, I asked him, If all thoſe that were there, were
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:5419:64"/> Gipſeyes, borne in <hi>Egypt.</hi> He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered me, The Deuill a one there was in all <hi>Spaine;</hi> but that they were all Prieſts, Friers, Nunnes, or Theeues that had broke out of Priſon, or out of their Cloyſters: but yet, that among them all, thoſe that came from Monaſteries, were the greateſt and moſt notorious Villaines, changing a contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue life into an actiue. Hee retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his companie, &amp; I on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe vpon S. <hi>Francis</hi> his Mule, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed my way to <hi>Valledolid.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XII. <hi>What hapned to</hi> Lazaro <hi>in a Tauerne two miles off from</hi> Valledolid.</head>
               <p>ALl the way long did I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but thinke vpon my good Gipſeyes, their life, cuſtomes, and behauiour. I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred much, how the Magiſtrates
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:5419:65"/> would ſuffer publike Theeues to goe ſo freely and openly; all the World knowing, that to filch and ſteale, is their onely Imployment and Occupation. They are the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge and Receptacle of all Rogues; the Sanctuarie for Apoſtataes; and the Schoole of all miſchiefe. But chiefely I did maruell, that Friers ſhould forſake their ſweet &amp; quiet life, for the miſerable and toileſome life of a Gipſey. Neither had I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued to be true, what the old Gipſey told me; had he not ſhowne me, halfe a mile from the place where they were lodged, behinde the Wall of a Cloſe, a Man and Woman Gipſey: hee frolicke and luſtie, ſhee plumpe and comely; hee not parched with the Sunne, ſhee not blaſted with the vnkindneſſe of the Weather: The one ſung a Verſe of the Pſalmes of <hi>Dauid;</hi> the other anſwered with another. The
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:5419:65"/> good old man aſſured me, that they were a Frier and a Nunne; who, not aboue eight dayes before, were come to their Congregation, with a deſire to make profeſſion of a moſt auſtere life. I followed my way, vntill I came to a Tauerne two miles off from <hi>Valledolid;</hi> at the doore whereof, I found ſitting the old Woman of <hi>Madrid,</hi> and the young Gentlewoman, of whom I haue ſpoken. There came out a young Gallant, to bid them come in to Dinner. They could not know me, I was ſo diſguiſed, with my Patch ſtill vpon my Eye, and my Cloathes right Beggars Cut; but I knew my ſelfe to be that <hi>Lazaro</hi> that was come out of the Graue, that had been ſo coſtly vnto mee. I went in after them, &amp; ſtood before them, to ſee if they would giue me ſomewhat: but it had beene a hard matter for them ſo to doe, hauing
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:5419:66"/> not enough for themſelues: for the worthy Gentleman, that had play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Steward, had beene ſo libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, that for himſelfe, his Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heart, and the old Baud, hee had cauſed to be made readie a little Hogs Liuer, with a ſawce to whet their appetite; all which, I could eaſily haue gobled vp, in leſſe then two Morſels. The Bread was as blacke as the Table-Cloth, which ſeemed like the Caſſocke of ſome Penitent, or the Maulkin where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <note place="margin">The ghoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fathers enioyne to ſome for a penance, to weare black Buckeram Caſſocks, with a Wax Candle in their hands, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie others that doe whip them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</note> an Ouen is made cleane. Eat, my Loue (ſaid the Gentleman) for this is a diet for a Prince. The Baud fell too roundly, and ſaid not one word for feare of loſing time, becauſe ſhee ſaw that ſhee was not to goe often to the Diſh; which they began to licke, and rubbe ſo hard, that (it being of Earth) they ſcraped away all the Varniſh. Their pitifull and ſhort Meale being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:5419:66"/> (which had rather prouoked, then in any manner aſſwaged their hunger) the gentle Louer made his excuſe, ſaying, That the Tauerne was vnprouided. I ſeeing, that there was nothing there for me, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the Hoſte, If he had any thing to eate? who anſwered me, Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the pay; and would haue giuen mee a little Hogs-Haſlet: but I asked him, if he had nothing elſe? hee offered me a Quarter of Kidde, that the amorous Gallant had refuſed, becauſe it was too deare. I thought to come ouer them with a Brauado, and ſo I bad him giue it me. I went and ſate downe with it at the lower end of the Table; where, it was a ſport to ſee how they looked vpon me. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery bit that I put into my mouth, did draw ſix eyes after it; for thoſe of the Louer, of the Gentlewoman, and of the Baud, were nayled to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:5419:67"/> what I did eate. How comes it to paſſe (ſaid the Damſell) that yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Beggar doth eate a Quarter of Kidde, and wee three haue had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a poore piece of fryed Liuer? The Gallant anſwered, That hee had asked the Hoſte for Partridges, Capons, or Hennes, and that hee had told him, that hee had nothing elſe to giue him. I, that knew how the matter went (and that for feare of ſpending, or for not hauing wherewithall, hee had dieted them) did notwithſtanding hold my peace, and ply my Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als. I thinke in my conſcience, that that Kiddes meate was a Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone; for when I leaſt tooke heed, I found them all three round about my Diſh. The ſhameleſſe and bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen-faced Wench tooke a piece, and ſaid, Brother by your leaue; but before ſhe had it, it was alreadie in her mouth. The old Mumbler re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:5419:67"/> Do not take away the poore Wretch his meat from him. I will not take it away (anſwered ſhe) for I doe meane to pay him very well for it; and in ſaying ſo, ſhee fell to it with ſuch haſte and greedineſſe, that it ſeemed ſhee had not eaten in ſixe dayes before. The good Matron tooke a bit, to know how it taſted. What (ſayth my Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant) doe you like it ſo well? and therewith pops me a piece in his mouth as bigge as his fiſt. But I perceiuing them to grow ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too bold, tooke all that was in the Diſh, and made but one mouthfull of it; which was ſo great, that I could neither get it backward nor forward. Beeing in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie, there came to the Tauerne gate two horſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, armed with coats of Mayle, Headpieces, &amp; Bucklers, ech of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> carying a Petronel at his ſide, &amp; another at their Saddle-bow:
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:5419:68"/> who alighting, gaue their Mules to a Foot-man, and asked the Hoſte if hee had any thing to eate? hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them, That hee had where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to giue them good entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and therefore, if it pleaſed their Worſhips, they might walke into the Hall, whileſt Meat was a making ready. The old Woman, who hearing the noyſe, was gone out to the doore, and came ſtraight in againe, with her two hands vpon her face, bending and bowing her body a thouſand times like a new hooded Monke, ſpeaking as out of a Trunke, and wreſting and wring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling now one ſide, then the other, as if ſhee had beene in Child-birth, as low and as well as ſhee could, ſhee ſaid, Wee are all vndone, for the Brothers of <hi>Clara</hi> (for ſo was the Gentlewoman called) are at the Gate. The young Wench hearing this, began to take on, and to pull
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:5419:68"/> her ſelfe by the haires, &amp; to thumpe and miſ-uſe her ſelfe, as if ſhee had beene out of her wits. But the young Gallant, that was ſtout and couragious, comforted her, and bad her be of good cheare; and that where hee was, ſhee needed not to feare any thing. I (who all this while had ſtill the great piece of Kidde in my mouth) when I vnderſtood that thoſe Swaſh-buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers were there, was like to haue died for feare; and had died in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, had it not beene that my Throat being ſtopped with the Meat, my Soule could find no paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to get out, and therefore was conſtrained to returne againe into her place. The two roaring Boyes came in; and as ſoone as they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued their ſiſter, and the old Hagge, they cryed out, Here they be, Now wee haue them, Kill, kill them. At this vproare, I was ſo
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:5419:69"/> affrighted, that I fell to the ground; and with the fall, I caſt out the Kidde that did choake me. The two Women put themſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde the Gentleman, as Chickens doe vnder the Hennes wings, when they runne away from a Kite. Hee with a braue ſpirit drew out his Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier, and went towards them with ſuch furie, that for very feare they ſtood ſtill like two Statues, their wordes beeing frozen in their mouths, and their Swords in their Scabberds. Hee asked them what they would, or what they ſought? and with that comming to the one, he pulled out his Sword, holding the point thereof at his eyes, and of his owne at the eyes of the other; ſo that at the leaſt motion of the Swords, they quaked and trembled like Leaues vpon a Tree. The old Woman and the Siſter ſeeing the two <hi>Brauachios</hi> ſo heartleſſe, came
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:5419:69"/> to them, and diſarmed them. The Hoſt came in at the noyſe that wee made (for I was already got vp, and had one of them by the Beard) not vnlike to the counterfeit Bulls of my Countrey, which childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at firſt ſight doe flye from; but growing bolder by little and little, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing that they are not wilde, nor what they ſeeme to be, do come ſo neere the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that (hauing loſt all feare) they caſt &amp; hang vpon them a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Diſh-clothes. So I ſeeing that thoſe ſcar-Crowes were not what they appeared to be, tooke heart at graſſe, &amp; ſet vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with as much boldneſſe as my former feare could affoord me. What is the matter here, ſaid the Hoſt? What ſtirre is this in my houſe? The Women, the Gentleman, and I began to cry out, They are Theeues, that come fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing vs, for to rob vs. The Hoſt that ſaw the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without their weapons,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:5419:70"/> and vs with the victorie, ſayd, What? Theeues in my houſe? And thereupon layd hands vpon them, and with our helpe, did put them into a Vault vnder ground, notwithſtanding any thing they could alledge to the contrarie. Their man, who by this time had giuen meate to their Mules, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in, &amp; asking for his Maſters, was by the Hoſt ſent to keepe them companie. Then did he take their Cloake-bagges, Mayles, and other furniture, and locked them vp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding their Weapons betweene vs, as if they had beene his owne. Hee asked nothing of vs for his Meate, that wee might be Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the Information which hee had made againſt them; vpon the which, as an Officer of the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which hee ſaid hee was) and as Iuſtice of that place, he condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them all three to the Galleyes
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:5419:70"/> for euer, and each of them to two hundred ſtripes round about the Tauerne. They appealed vnto the <hi>Chancerie</hi> of <hi>Valledolid;</hi> whither the good Hoſt, and three of his ſeruants did carry them. But when the vnfortunate Wretches thought they had beene before the ſecular Iudges, they found themſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Inquiſitors: for the ſubtile and malicious Tauerner had put within the Informations certaine ſpeeches that they had ſaid againſt the Miniſters of the holy Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; an irremiſſible offence. They put them in darke Dungeons; from whence (as they thought to haue done) they could not write to their Father, nor come to the ſpeech of any that might helpe them. And there wee will leaue them in good hold, to returne to our Hoſt, whom wee met on the way: who told vs, That the Lords of the Inquiſition
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:5419:71"/> had giuen him charge to bring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them the Witneſſes, that had giuen euidence in the cauſe; but that notwithſtanding (as our friend) hee did aduiſe vs to abſent our ſelues. The Gentlewoman gaue him a Ring that ſhee had vpon her finger; deſiring him ſo to worke, as we might not appeare before them: hee did promiſe it. Now had the Raſcall ſaid this, onely to make vs be gone; for feare that (if wee had beene heard) his Villanie (which was not the firſt) ſhould haue been diſcouered. About a fortnight af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there was a generall Execution at <hi>Valledolid;</hi> where, among other priſoners, I ſaw the three poore Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels come forth with Gags in their mouthes, as Blaſphemers, that had beene ſo preſumptuous, as to touch with their tongue the Miniſters of the holy Inquiſition; men euen as holy and perfect, as the Iuſtice they
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:5419:71"/> doe adminiſtrate. They wore each of them a penitent Garment, called a <hi>Sanbenito,</hi> and a Paper Miter vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their heads; whereon were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten their offences, and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be inflicted vpon them for the ſame. It grieued me to ſee the poore Foot-man pay what hee did not owe: as for the two other, I had not ſo much pitty of them, for the little they had had of me. They confirmed the Sentence of the Hoſt, adding moreouer and aboue to euery one of them three hundred ſtripes: ſo that they gaue them fiue hundred apeece, &amp; ſent them to the Gallies, where their brags &amp; braua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does had leyſure to take breath and coole themſelues. For my part, I did ſeek my fortune, &amp; many times <note place="margin">Magdelaine Field, is a place to walke in at Valledolid, as Moore-Fields in London.</note> in * <hi>Magdelaine</hi> Field did I meete the two Women, who neuer yet knew me, nor thought that I had knowne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. A while after I ſaw the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:5419:72"/> young Gentlewoman, who had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp a Lodging, where ſhee lay backwards, and did let her fore-roomes, to get wherewith to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine her ſelfe and her Gallant. As for the old Woman, ſhe fell againe to her old Trade in that Citie.</p>

               <p>I Came to <hi>Valledolid</hi> with ſix Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als in my Purſe; by reaſon that euery one ſeeing mee ſo leane and ſo pale, did giue me their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities very freely, and I was not ſlacke in receiuing. I went direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Brokers; where, for foure <note place="margin">A Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillo is three halfe pence.</note> Ryals and a Quartillo I bought me a long Frize Cloake, that had been ſome Portugals, euen as thredbare as tattered and vnſowne; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:5419:72"/> and a high Steeple-crownd Hat, with broad brims, like a <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcan</hi> Fryer, that I bought for halfe a Ryall, and with a Staffe in my hand, I walked the ſtreetes. All that ſaw me, did laugh at me, and euery one gaue me their Squib. One called mee Tauerne-Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher: another, Behold where Saint <hi>Peter</hi> goeth, apparrelled as on a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-day Eue. Some would ſay, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of <hi>Portugall,</hi> will you haue any Greaſe to anoint your Bootes. Others there were, who affirmed, that I ſeemed to bee the Ghoſt of ſome Hoſpitall Phyſician. But I with Merchants eares, heard all, ſayd nothing, and ſtill paſſed on. I had not gone through many Streetes, when I met a Woman with a great Fardingale, and Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens of the largeſt ſize, who leaned her hand vpon a Boyes head, and was couered with a Cypres Veyle
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:5419:73"/> vnto her ſtomacke; ſhe asked mee if I could tell her of any Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Vſher: I anſwered her, that I knew of none, but my ſelf, of whom (if it pleaſed her) ſhe might diſpoſe as of her owne. The agreement was made betwixt vs without any farther delay, ſhee promiſing mee for meate, drinke and wages, three quartillos a day. I tooke poſſeſſion <note place="margin">That is 4. pence halfe penny.</note> of the Office, and gaue her my arme, and threw away my Staffe, as hauing now no more need of it, for I carryed it only to be thought ſicke, and mooue people to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion. Shee ſent the Boy home, bidding him tell the Maide ſhe ſhould lay the Cloth, &amp; make rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy dinner. She led me aboue two houres vp and downe from one place to another. The firſt viſite we came at, the good Gentlewoman warned me, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we came nigh the houſe that ſhe was to goe to, I
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:5419:73"/> ſhould run before &amp; enquire if the Maſter or the Miſtreſſe were within, and ſay, My Miſtreſſe <hi>Ieane Perez</hi> (for that was her name) is here, who deſireth to kiſſe their hands. She told me moreouer, that when ſhe did ſtay any where, I was neuer to haue my Hat on before her: I anſwered her, that I knew very well the dutie of a Seruant, and that I would performe it. I had an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding deſire to ſee the face of my new Miſtreſſe, but I could not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe was vailed. She told me that ſhee could not maintaine mee alone for her ſelfe; but that ſhee would finde ſome of her neighbors whom I might ſerue, and that betweene them they would giue mee the conſideration ſhee had promiſed mee, and in the meane time (till they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted, which would bee verie ſhortly) ſhe would pay me her part.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:5419:74"/> Shee asked me, if I knew where to lye a Nights? I told her, No. You ſhall not want Lodging (ſaid ſhee) for my Husband is a Taylor, and hath Prentices, with whom you ſhall ſhare Bedding: You could not haue found a better place in the whole Citie; for before three dayes be at an end, you ſhall haue ſix Miſtreſſes, and euery one ſhall giue you a Quarto, which will be <note place="margin">3. Blankes are 3. far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</note> three Blancks more then I haue promiſed you. I could not but wonder at the ſtate and grauitie of that Woman, who ſeemed (at the leaſt) the Wife of ſome great Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, or wealthy Citizen: and withall, it aſtoniſhed mee to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how for three poore Quartil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los, and three Blanckes a day, I was to waite vpon ſeuen Miſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. But I conſidered, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was better then nothing, and that the Office was not painefull, a
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:5419:74"/> thing I hated as the Deuill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: for I haue alwayes choſen ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to eate Cabbage and Garlike without working; then to worke, and feede vpon Hennes and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons. When wee came home, ſhee gaue me her Veyle and Pattens, to deliuer them to the Maid, and then I ſaw what I ſo much deſired. I found, that my little Woman was handſome enough; ſhee was browne, of a good behauiour, and comely feature. What I only diſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in her, was, that her face did ſhine like an Earthen Porrenger varniſhed. She gaue me the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, bidding me come twice a day, once at eight a clocke in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and againe at three in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoone, to know if ſhe would go abroad, or no. I went from thence to a Cookes-ſhop, and with a Pie of a quarto I made an end of my al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, paſſing the reſt of the day
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:5419:75"/> like a Cameleon; for I had already ſpent the Almes that had beene giuen me vpon the way, and durſt not fall a begging againe, for my Miſtreſſe (if ſhee had knowne it) would haue eaten me quicke. I went to her houſe at three a clocke; ſhe told me, that ſhe would not go foorth, but that ſhe would haue me know, that from thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſhe would pay nothing that day ſhe went not abroade, and if ſo bee ſhe went out but once in a whole day, I ſhould then haue but two Marauedies. Furthermore, ſhe <note place="margin">A Maraue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is the leaſt mony they haue in spaine, and is worth a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue halfe a farding of our mony.</note> ſayde, that ſince ſhe allowed mee my bedding, ſhe did alſo expect to be ſerued before all others, and that I ſhould entitle my ſelfe her ſeruant. The Bed (to ſpeake truth) was ſuch, as it deſerued well that prerogatiue and much more, for ſhee made mee lye with her Prentiſes vpon a great
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:5419:75"/> Table, and the diuell any thing elſe there was, but an old rotten thred-bare Blanket to couer vs. I paſſed foure dayes with the plentifull Diet that foure Mara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedies could affoord me, and at the end of them, there entred into the ſocietie a Tauerners wife who was aboue an houre in bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining for the poore quarto. To conclude, within fiue dayes I found ſeauen Miſtreſſes, and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen quartos a day of allowance, ſo that I began to liue very ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didiouſly, drinking not of the worſt Wine, though not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of the beſt, that ſo I might cut my Cloake according to my cloath. The other fiue were, a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants widdow, a Gardners wife, the bare footed Nunnes Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines Neece (for ſo ſhe ſtiled her ſelfe) a wench for any thing; and a Tripe-wife, whom I did beſt
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:5419:76"/> affect, becauſe that when ſhee did pay me her Quarto, ſhee would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies bid me to ſome of her Tripe-broath, of the which before I went out of her houſe, I would ſend ſome three or foure Porrengers ful into my guts; ſo that I liued ſo well that I pray God I may neuer liue worſe. The laſt was a deuout wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (called a <hi>Beata)</hi> with whom I had more to doe, then with all the reſt; for ſhe neuer viſited any but Monkes and Friers, with whom when ſhe was alone, ſhe was in her kingdome: her houſe was like a Bee-Hiue, ſome went out, and other came in, but all of them with their great ſleeues ſtored with one thing or other. They gaue me (that I might be ſecret) ſome peeces of meate, which they ſaued in their ſleeues, out of their allowance in the Conuet. I neuer ſaw in all my life a better hypocrite then this
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:5419:76"/> my Miſtreſſe was; when ſhe went through the ſtreet ſhee neuer lifted her eyes from the ground; and her beades were neuer out of her hands wherewith ſhee ſtill mumbled her prayers. Al ſuch as knew her would deſire her to pray to God for them, for without doubt her prayers were very acceptable vnto him. Shee would anſwer them, that ſhee was a great ſinner (wherein ſhee lyed not, but couſened them with the naked truth.) Now had euery one of theſe my Miſtreſſes their ſet houres, when one had told mee that ſhe would not ſtirre foorth, I went to another till I had ended my taske. But eſpecially I was (and that without faile) to go find them againe at my appointed time; for if by miſchance I miſſed neuer ſo little, then would my Miſtreſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the company that ſhe viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſcold and rayle me out of my
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:5419:77"/> skinne; &amp; threaten me, that if I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in this careleſneſſe &amp; negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, ſhe would ſeeke out another Gentleman-Vſher that ſhould be more diligent, obſeruant, and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual. So that to heare her brawle &amp; threaten with ſuch arrogancy, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would haue thought ſhe had giuen me euery day 2. Ryals for my diet onely, and 30 Duckets a yeere ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Wages. When they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, one would haue taken them for the wiues of ſome Preſidents of <hi>Caſtilla,</hi> at the leaſt of ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours. It fortuned one day that the Chaplaines Neece, and the Sergeants wife met together in a Church, and being both of them to returne home at the ſame time, there aroſe a great controuerſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, which of the two I was to accompany, making a noyſe as if they had bin in a Faire. They pulled and tugged me, one of this
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:5419:77"/> ſide, another of that ſide, with ſuch rage and fury, that at length they tore my cloake in pieces, leauing me ſtarke naked; for the diuell any other cloathes had I vnder it but a ragged ſhirt that looked like a fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermans net. Thoſe that through the caſements thereof did caſt their eyes vpon the nuditie of my fleſh, did burſt out into extreame laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Some would mocke poore <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaro;</hi> &amp; others gaue eare to the two women who pulled their grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers out of their graues. The haſte I had to gather vp againe the pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of my cloake, which, for being ſomwhat too ripe, were falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the ground, would not permit me to heare what they ſaid one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; onely I heard the widdow ſay, Where hath this Baggage (I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) gotten all this pride? but yeſterday ſhee was a Tankard-wench, &amp; to day ſhe ruffles it in her
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:5419:78"/> ſilkes, at the coſt of the ſoules in Purgatory. The other replyed, But you Miſtreſſe Wag-taile do mince it in your Stammell, earned of thoſe who with a <hi>Deo gratias,</hi> and a God reward you, do pay for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they poſſeſſe: and if I yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day carried the water Tankard, you beare to day the wine Bottle. The company that ſtood by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, for they had already one another faſt by the haire. Hauing gathered vp the diſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of my poore cloake, I asked a couple of pinnes of a mumbler of Pater-noſters that was there, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I mended it as well as I could to hide my nakedneſſe: and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them brawling, I went me to my Miſtreſſe the Taylors wife, who had warned me to come and fetch her at eleuen a clocke, becauſe ſhee was to goe to dinner at a friends houſe; when ſhe ſaw mee in this
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:5419:78"/> pickle, ſhe began to fal a ſcoulding at me; ſaying, What do you thinke to earne my money by waiting on me thus like a Roague? with farre leſſe wages then I giue you I could haue a Gentleman-Vſher with handſome Trouſes, a neat Doublet a good Cloake, and a comely Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net; and you doe nothing but Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vp all I giue you. What Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling (ſayd I to my ſelfe) with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen poore quartos that I earne a day, when I earne the moſt, for many paſſed that my Miſtreſſes for feare of paying mee my quarto, would not goe abroade. She made the peeces of my Cloake to bee ſtitched one to another, and for very haſte they put them vpſide downewards, in which manner I waited on her.</p>

               <p>WE poſted like a Frier inuited to a feaſt; for the good Lady fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red there ſhould not be enough for her. We came to her friends houſe, where we found other women that were likewiſe inuited, who asked my Miſtreſſe, Whether I was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to keepe the doore? ſhee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them, Yes. Then they ſayd to me, Stand here brother, to day you ſhall fare royally. There came in many gallants, euery one pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out of his pocket, this man a Partridge, and that man a Henne; one brought forth a Rabbet, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a paire of Pigeons; this a peece of Mutton, that a chine of Porke; ſome drew out Sawſiges or Chit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlings:
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:5419:79"/> and ſuch a one there was, that pulled out a Pie of a Ryall wrapped vp in his Handkercher. They deliuered all to the Cooke, and whileſt dinner was in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, they ſported with the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women. What paſſed there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, is neither lawfull for me to reherſe, nor for the Reader to contemplate. But the Play be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended, meate was ſerued in, and all ſate downe, the Gentlewomen plying the diſhes ſoundly; and the Gallants taking their Cups round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. What remained vpon the table, the women put it vp in their pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets. The Gentlemen returning to their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dkerchiefs, drew forth their laſt courſe. One broght out apples, another Cheeſe, another Oliues, &amp; one of them (who was the chiefe and ſtitched the Tailers wife) drew out halfe a pound of Comfits. This manner of carrying meate ſo neere
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:5419:80"/> at hand for any neceſſity, did pleaſe me wondrous well, and therefore from thence forwards, I purpoſed to make three or foure pockets in the firſt breeches that God ſhould ſend me (for at that time I had not any) and one of them ſhould be of ſuch leather as blacke Iackes are made of, very well ſowne to put porridge in. For if thoſe Gallants that were ſo rich, and ſo noted, did bring all the prouiſion in their pockets: and the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women did carry it away crammed within theirs. I (who was but Vſher to a crew of Cockatrices) might very well do it. We went at length among vs ſeruants to dinner, and the diuell any thing elſe was there for vs, but Porridge and Sops. I wondred that the good Ladies had not alſo put that into their wide ſleeues. We had hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to eate, when we heard a great
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:5419:80"/> noyſe in the Roome where our Maſters were. They diſputed who their Parents had beene, and what the Womens Husbands were; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till that leauing wordes, they fell roundly to blowes, and pell-mell one with another, did let hands, feete, teeth, and nayles doe their function, in ſcratching, biting, kic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, cuffing, and tugging one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the haires. The occaſion of this Vprore (as farre as I could vnderſtand) was, that ſome of the Gallants would neyther giue, nor pay any thing to the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, telling them, that what they had eaten, did ſuffice. It chanced, that vpon this ſtirre, a Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, with other Officers of Iuſtice, did paſſe through the Street; who hearing the noyſe, came to the Doore, and charged them to open in the Kings Name: Which words being heard, euery one began to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:5419:81"/> runne, one this way, another that way: One left his Cloake, another his Sword: This Woman left her Pattens; that, her Veyle: ſo that all vaniſhed, and hid themſelues, euery one where beſt hee could. I, (who had done nothing for which I ſhould runne away) did not ſtirre; but (as I was Porter) opened the Doore, leaſt they ſhould accuſe mee to haue reſiſted the Kings Officers. The firſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant that entred, taking firſt hold of me by the necke, ſaid, That hee arreſted mee: and being thus in his hold, they ſhut faſt the Doores, and went to ſeeke thoſe that had made the noyſe. They left no Chamber, Cloſet, Butterie, Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, Garret, nor Priuie vnſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but ſeeing they could finde no body, they tooke my exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. I confeſſed from one end to the other, who thoſe were that
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:5419:81"/> were there, and what they had done. They wondred, that there being ſo many, as I ſayd; they could not finde any: And to ſpeake the truth, I my ſelfe was much amazed at it, for there were twelue Men, and ſixe Women. Wherefore I told them (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede I did beleeue it) that I thought, that all thoſe that had beene there, and made that noyſe, were Spirits; whereupon they fell a laughing at me. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſarie asked thoſe that had beene in the Cellar, if they had ſearched well in euery corner: they anſwered him, Yes. But hee not ſatisfied therewith, cauſed a Torch to be lighted, to goe downe himſelfe. Entring at the doore, they ſaw a great Tub rowle vp and downe the Cellar; wherewith the Sergeants beeing frighted, began to runne away, ſaying:
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:5419:82"/> By God this man ſayth true, heere are nothing but Hobgoblins. The Commiſſarie, who was more craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſtayed them, ſaying, That hee did not feare the Deuill; and with that, went to the Tub, and opening it, found within it a Man and a Woman, both of them as naked as their Mother brought them into the World, by reaſon, that when the ſaid Commiſſarie did knocke at the doore, they were a bed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon termes of agreement, and had not had the leyſure, vpon the ſudden Alarum, to take their Clothes; but as they were, had hid themſelues within that empty Tub. They were all amazed to ſee them both ſo faire; but caſting Cloakes vpon them, they committed them to the cuſtodie of two Sergeants, and went on to ſeeke the others. The Commiſſarie diſcouered a great Earthen Veſſell full of Oyle,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:5419:82"/> within the which hee found a man cloathed, and vp to the breſt in the ſaid Oyle: who (as ſoone as they perceiued him) thought to haue leaped forth; which he could not doe ſo artificially, but that both hee and the Veſſell came to the ground, ſo that the Oyle did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound vp to their Hats, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſpect ſtayned them all; which made them curſe both the Office, and the Deuill that firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented it. The Oyly man, ſeeing that no body did ſtay him (but to the contrary, that all fled from him as from a mad Dogge) betooke himſelfe to his heeles; and though the Commiſſarie cryed out, Stay him, Stay him, yet neuertheleſſe euery one gaue him way, ſo that he went out at a back-doore, piſſing Oyle, of the which he had enough out of his Garments, to maintaine the Lampe of our Lady of Diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:5419:83"/> a month and more. All the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers remained drenched in oyle, curſing him that had brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thither, and me alſo: for they ſayd I was the Bawd, and for ſuch a one ſhould be puniſhed. They came out of the Cellar as Fritters out of a Frying-pan, leauing a tract whereſoeuer they paſſed. They were ſo angry, that they vowed to God and the foure Euangeliſts to hang all thoſe that they found; which made vs priſoners to ſtinke for feare. They went to Corne and Meale roomes to ſeeke out the reſt; and being there, from aboue through a trap-doore was a ſack of Meale powred vpon them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were all blinded, and cryed out, Violence to the Kings Officers: and if they thought to open their eyes, they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly cloſed vp with water and meale. Thoſe that had the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:5419:83"/> of vs, left vs to goe helpe the Commiſſarie, that roared out like a mad-man. But they were ſcarce entred, when their eyes alſo were filled with Meale and Water: ſo that they went vp and downe, as if they had beene playing at Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-buffe; and meeting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this manner, did enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change ſuch Cuffes and Blowes, that they brake one anothers Chops, and Teeth. When wee ſaw them in ſuch diſorder, wee came in vpon them, and they vpon themſelues with ſuch might, that being wearie, and out of breath, they fell to the ground, where blowes and ſpurnes fell vpon them as thicke as hayle, vntill they were as ſtill as if they had beene dead: for if any one did but open his mouth to grunt neuer ſo little, hee had it ſtraightwayes filled with Meale, and crammed like a Capon.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:5419:84"/> Wee bound them hand and foot, and carryed them into the Cellar, and threw them into the Oyle, like Fiſhes to be fryed, where they wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed like Hogges in the myre. Then did wee ſhut vp all the doores, euery one returning to his owne houſe. The owner of the houſe, where theſe Reakes were played (who was gone into the Countrey) comming home pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after, and finding the doores faſt, and that no body did anſwere (by reaſon that a Neece of his, to whom he had encharged his houſe, which ſhee had lent for that mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, was gone home to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for feare of her Vnckle) hee cauſed the doores to be broken o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. But when hee found his houſe all ſtrewed with Meale, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dawbed with Oyle, hee was ſo vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that hee tooke on as if hee had beene drunke: then hee went into
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:5419:84"/> his Cellar, where hee found all the Oyle ſpilt, and the Officers tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in it. With rage and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to ſee his goods ſpoyled after this manner, he tooke a great Cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, and gaue the Commiſſarie and the Sergeants ſo many blowes, that hee left them for halfe dead: then calling his neighbours to his ayde, they carryed them into the Street, where the Boyes fell a throwing Mudde, Durt, and Shoo-Clouts vpon them; for they were ſo full of Meale, that no body could know them. When they came againe to themſelues, and perceiued they were in the Street, and vnbound, they preſently roſe vp, and betooke themſelues to their heeles; ſo that one might very wel then haue ſaid, Stop the Conſtable. They left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them their Cloakes, Swords, and Daggers; not daring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe for them, that no
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:5419:85"/> body might know the Buſineſſe. The Maſter of the houſe tooke poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of all, in recompence of the loſſe hee had ſuſtained. When I went out of the houſe, to goe my way, I met with a Cloake that was none of the worſt, which I tooke vp, and left mine in ſtead of it. I gaue God thankes, that I came off ſo well in that dayes aduenture; which was a new world to me, who was wont alwayes to goe by the worſt. I went to the Taylors Wiues houſe, where I found a great hurly-burly, and the Taylor taking meaſure of his Wiues ribbes with a good Cudgell, becauſe ſhee was come home alone, without Veyle, or Pattens, running through the ſtreets with more then a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Boyes at her tayle. I came in good time: for as ſoone as the Taylor ſaw me, hee left his Wife, and fell vpon my Iacke, giuing
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:5419:85"/> me a blow with his fiſt ouer the Face, wherewith he ſtruck out thoſe few Teeth that I had left me, and ſome tenne or twelue ſpurnes in the Guts, that made me caſt vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine that little which I had eaten. What (ſaid he) infamous Band, are you not aſhamed to come to my houſe? You ſhall ſurely now pay your old and new Score both at once: and calling to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to bring forth a Blanket, they put me into it, and toſſed me at their pleaſures, and my great griefe, leauing me for dead; and in that caſe they layd me vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Bench, being alreadie night. When I came againe to my ſelfe, and thought to haue ſtirred, I fell to the ground, and with the fall, I brake one of my Armes. The Day beeing come, by little and by little I crawled vnto a Church Gate: Where, with a
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:5419:86"/> pittifull voyce, I craued the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Almes of ſuch perſons as went in and out.</p>

               <p>LYing at the Church Doore, and making a collection of my former life; I conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all the misfortunes that I had paſſed, from the day that I began to ſerue the Blind man, vntill the preſent inſtant: And all Recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings made vp, I found, that riſing early, did not bring on the day fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, nor continuall toyle make a man alwayes rich; but as the Song ſayth:</p>
               <l>The early riſer doth not thriue,</l>
               <l>So well as he whom God doth driue.</l>
               <p>To him I recommended my ſelfe,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:5419:86"/> that the end might prooue better then eyther the beginning or the middle had beene. It was my chance to be cloſe to a venerable and white-bearded Hermite, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a Staffe and Beades in his hand, at the end whereof did hang a Deaths-head, of the bigneſſe of a Conies. This good Father ſeeing me diſtreſſed, with kind and milde ſpeeches began to comfort me, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king me from whence I was, and what chances had brought me to this eſtate? I, in few and compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious tearmes, gaue him to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the long and large extent of my bitter and painfull Pilgrimage. Hee was amazed to heare me, and mooued with pietie and pittie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, hee inuited me home to his Hermitage. I accepted of his offer, and as well as I could (which was with no little paine) wee came to the Oratorie, which was two
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:5419:87"/> miles from thence in a Rocke; cloſe to the which, there was a Chamber with a hollowneſſe in one of the walls, where his bed ſtood. Within the Yard was a Ciſterne with freſh water, wherewith he watred a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, more curious and neate, then vaſte and ſpacious. Here (ſaid the good old man) haue I liued theſe twenty yeeres, free from the iarring and vnquietneſſe of the World: this is (my Brother) the earthly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice. Here doe I contemplate both diuine and humane matters: here doe I faſt when I am filled, and eate when I am hungry: here doe I watch, when I cannot ſleepe; and ſleepe, when I am wearie of watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Here am I ſolitary, when I want company; and am accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, when I am not alone. Here doe I ſing, when I am merry; and weepe, when I am ſad. Here doe I worke, when I am not idle; and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:5419:87"/> am idle, when I doe not worke. Here do I thinke vpon my bad life that is paſſed; &amp; conſider the good one that is preſent. Here, laſtly, it is where all things are vnknowne; and where the knowledge of all things is attained. It did mee good at the heart to heare the merrily diſpoſed Hermite: And therefore I deſired him to giue mee ſome notion of the Hermiticall life, for it ſeemed to me the quinteſſence of all others. It is by ſo much the beſt (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered hee) that hee onely can tell who hath made tryall of it: but wee can not now haue ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to diſcourſe any farther vpon it, by reaſon that it is din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner time. I intreated him to giue mee ſome remedie for my arme, which was very ſore. He did it with ſuch eaſe &amp; facilitie, as fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence forwards it pained mee no more.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:5419:88"/> Wee did eate like Kings, and dranke like <hi>Germans.</hi> Dinner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended, in the middeſt of our Noone-ſleepe, the good Hermite began to cry out, I dye, I dye. I preſently aroſe, and found him rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to giue vp the Ghoſt. Seeing him in this caſe, I asked him if hee was a dying; hee anſwered me, I, I, I: and onely repeating I, dyed within an houre after. I found my ſelfe in a pecke of troubles; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that if the man did dye without witneſſes, one might ſay, that I had killed him, and ſo it would coſt me my life, which till then with ſo much adoe I had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued; and that few witneſſes would ſerue to conuince me of the Fact, by reaſon that my Garbe and Faſhion would make me be taken rather for a Robber vpon the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, then for a man of worſhip. I came inſtantly out of the Cell,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:5419:88"/> to ſee if I could finde thereabouts any body, to be a witneſſe of that death: and looking on euery ſide, I perceiued a flocke of Sheepe not farre from thence, towards the which I went in all haſte (though not without paine, feeling the Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor ſtill vpon my bones) where I found ſix or ſeuen Shepheards, and foure or fiue Shepheardeſſes, vnder the ſhade of certaine Willowes, neere adioyning to a delightfull &amp; cleare Spring. The Shepheards did pipe, the Shepheardeſſes did ſing; ſome capered, and others danced: one held a Wench by the hand, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſlept in another Wenches Lap. Briefely, they all paſſed away the heat of the day in Loue-Games &amp; pleaſant diſcourſes. I came vnto them panting &amp; out of breath, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that without any ſtay they would come with me, for the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite lay a dying. Some of them fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:5419:89"/> me, leauing the reſt to keepe their flockes. Being entred into the Hermitage, they asked the good Hermite, whether he did meane to die? who anſwered them, I, (but he lyed, for hee had no mind to it, but was forced to it againſt his will.) When I ſaw that hee perſiſted ſtill in one &amp; the ſame note, anſwering I, to all queſtions; I asked him, If he intended that thoſe Shepheards ſhould be his Executors? he ſaid, I. I asked him if he did not make me his ſole and lawfull heire? he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I. I went on asking him, if hee did not acknowledge and confeſſe, that whatſoeuer hee did or might poſſeſſe, was due vnto me, both for my good and acceptable ſeruices, as for diuerſe things which hee had receiued of me? he againe ſaid, I; which I, I wiſhed might haue been the laſt accent of his life. But as I perceiued, that there was yet ſome
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:5419:89"/> breath in his body (fearing leaſt he ſhould beſtow it to my loſſe and dammage) I went on ſtill with my demands, cauſing one of the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards to note downe all that hee ſaid: which the Shepheard did with a Coale againſt the Wall, becauſe hee had neyther Penne nor Inck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horne. I asked him, If hee was not content, that that Shepheard ſhould ſigne and ſubſcribe for him vnto his Will, ſince hee himſelfe was vnable to doe it? he anſwered, I, I, I, and thereupon dyed. Wee tooke order for his Buriall, making a Graue for him in his Garden with the greateſt ſpeed that might be, for the feare that I had leaſt hee ſhould riſe againe. I deſired the Shepheards to take part of a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; but they thanked me, by reaſon, that it was alreadie time to driue foorth their Cattell, for to feede: and ſo they departed,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:5419:90"/> ſaying, they were very heauy for my loſſe. I locked faſt the doore of the Cell, and ranſacked inſtantly euery corner. I found a great Earthen Veſſell full of good Wine, &amp; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Oyle; two Pots of Honey, two ſides of Bacon, much poudred Meat, and ſome dryed Fruits; all which did pleaſe me very well, but yet it was not that which I did ſeek. I found his Cheſts full of Linnen; and in a corner of one of them, a Womans garment. Although that made me wonder, yet I wondred more, that a man ſo prouident and thriftie as hee was, ſhould be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Money. I was in mind to goe to his Graue, and aske him where he had put it; and me thought, that hauing asked him, he made me this anſwere: Thou Foole, doeſt thou thinke, that liuing in this vnneigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured and ſolitarie place, at the mercy of euery Rogue and Theefe,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:5419:90"/> I was to keepe within a Trunke (in danger of loſing it) that which I lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued &amp; eſteemed more then my life? This inſpiration (as if really I had receiued it from his mouth) made me ſeek in euery corner: but finding nothing, I conſidered with my ſelf, That if I were to hide Money in ſuch a place as no body might ſind it, where would I put it? I ſayd, within yonder Altar; to the which I went inſtantly, and lifting vp the Cloth that hung before it, at one ſide of it, being all of Bricke, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued a Chinke wide enough one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to put through a Ryall of eight. <note place="margin">A Ryall of eight is worth foure ſhillings,</note> My bloud began to riſe, &amp; my heart to pant. I tooke a Pick-axe, and in leſſe then two blowes, I threw halfe the Altar to the ground, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the Reliques that were there intombed. I found a Pot of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which I told out, and found the ſumme to be ſix hundred Ryals.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:5419:91"/> The ioy &amp; content that I receiued was ſo great, that I had like to haue died. I took it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence, &amp; digged a Hole without the Hermitage, where I buried it, that (if I were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen from thence) I might find with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, that which I ſo highly &amp; dearly cheriſhed. That done, I cloathed my ſelfe in the Hermites Weeds, &amp; went to the City, to giue notice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Prior of the Society, of what was paſſed; not forgetting before I went, to mend vp againe the Altar as it was before. It was my fortune to meet all the Brethren together, of whom the Hermitage did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, which was conſecrated to Saint <hi>Lazaro,</hi> whence I gathered a good prognoſtick for my ſelfe: who when they ſaw me alreadie gray-headed, and of an exemplary aſpect (which is moſt requiſite for ſuch Profeſſions) although they found one difficulty, which was, that I had
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:5419:91"/> no Beard (becauſe it was not yet growne againe, hauing ſhaued it not long before) yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ſeeing (by the report of the Shepheards) that the deceaſed had made me his Heire, they gaue me the hold &amp; poſſeſſion of the Hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. But now I ſpeake of Beards, I remember what a certain Frier did once tel me, which was, that in their Order and in others of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ſort, they neuer make any Superior, vnleſſe he be well furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Beard: by means where of it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe, that many who are ſufficient &amp; capable to exerciſe that charge, are excluded; &amp; others pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the ſame, though vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, ſo that their Chin be wel ſtored with downe: as if to rule &amp; gouerne wel, did rather depend of haires, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a good &amp; ripe vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding. The Brothers admoniſhed me to liue according to the example &amp; good
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:5419:92"/> reputation of my Predeceſſor, which was ſuch, as euery one held him for a Saint. I told them, that I would ſhew my ſelfe a <hi>Hercules.</hi> They warned mee likewiſe, that I ſhould not begge but vpon Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes and Saterdayes, becauſe if I did otherwiſe, the Fryers would puniſh me. I promiſed them to fulfill in all points what they ſhould ordaine me (and the rather, becauſe I had no great minde to come into their clutches, hauing already tryed of what mettle their hands were made.) I began then to begge from doore to doore, with a low, humble and deuout tone (as I had learned in the blind mans Schoole) and that not for any need, but becauſe it is a vſe &amp; cuſtome among Beggars, who the more they haue, the more they deſire, &amp; with more guſt. The folks that did heare me ſay, Pray beſtow ſomething towards the lamp of the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:5419:92"/> good Saint <hi>Lazaro,</hi> and did not know the voyce, came out to the Doore, and ſeeing me, did wonder much, &amp; asked me, Where the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Anſelmo</hi> was? (for ſo was the good old man called) I told them that hee was departed this world. The one ſayd, Now God be with him and giue him good reſt that was ſo good a man. The others, May his bleſſed Soule enioy cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall happineſſe. Some ſaid, Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be he that led ſuch a life; for in ſixe yeeres hee hath not eaten any hot meate whatſoeuer. Others ſaid He faſted with bread and water. Some fooliſh and Superſtitious women would kneele downe and call vpon the father <hi>Anſelmo.</hi> One asked mee what I had done with his habit. I told her that it was the ſame that I did weare. She (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſaying what ſhe would haue) pulled out her Sizars, and began
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:5419:93"/> to cut off a piece of that ſhe could firſt lay hold on, which was iuſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my fore-parts; wherupon I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to cry out, fearing ſhee would haue gelded me. But ſhe ſeeing me ſo diſmayd, ſaid, Feare not Brother, for I wil not be without a relique of that bleſſed man, but I will pay for the damage done to your garment. Ah (ſaid ſome) without doubt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſix months be at an end, he wil be canonized, for he hath done ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miracles. There came ſo many to ſee his Sepulchre, that the houſe was alwayes full; wherefore I thought it fit to bring him forth vnder a Pent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe before the Hermitage: &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence forward, I begd no more for S. <hi>Lazaro's</hi> Lamp, but for that of the Bleſſed <hi>Anſelmo.</hi> I could neuer yet vnderſtand that maner of Begging, Giue to the Lampe, or for to light the Saints. But I will not harpe too much vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſtring, for it wil jarre
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:5419:93"/> in the eares of thoſe, who with the Saints Oile do maintain the Lamps of their ſtomacks. I cared not much to go to the City, hauing within the Cell what I deſired; yet leaſt they ſhould ſay I was rich, &amp; therefore I did not beg, I went thither the day folowing, where befel me that which you may read in the next Chapter.</p>

               <p>GOod lucke is better then a patrimony; to an vnfortunat man, a Hog is no better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Dog. Wee ſee oftentimes many men ſpring from the ſlime of the earth, and without knowing how, they do find themſelues rich, hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, feared, &amp; eſteemed. If you aske, Is that man learned? one wil anſwer you, As an Aſſe. Is he wiſe? As a Wood-Cock. Hath he any good qualities? As many as a Carman.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:5419:94"/> From whence then commeth to him all his wealth? One will tell you, From Fortune. And contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, many that are diſcreete, wiſe, prudent, full of a thouſand perfections, and fit to rule a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, doe ſee themſelues needy, ſcorned, deiected, and made the Diſh-Clouts of the world. If you demand the reaſon hereof: One will anſwer you, A croſſe Fortune doth purſue them. The ſame (as I think) purſued and perſecuted me, giuing in me an inſtance vnto the world, of what ſhe is able to doe; for ſince the foundation of it, no man hath beene ſo toſſed by that vnfortunate Fortune. But to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low my diſcourſe. I went through a ſtreete begging (as I was wont) for the good Saint <hi>Lazaro;</hi> (for I durſt not begge within the Cittie for the bleſſed <hi>Anſelmo,</hi> that was onely for Idiots and ſuperſtitious
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:5419:94"/> women that came to rub their beades vpon his ſepulcher, where according to their ſayings, many miracles were done.) And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to a doore, and doing there as at others, I heard ſome body call mee from the ſtaires-head, ſaying; Come vp, Father, come vp: What meane you to be ſo ſtrange? I went vp, and vpon the midſt of the ſtaires (which were ſomwhat darke) certaine women met me. The one hung about my necke, the others tooke me by the hands, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing with theirs into my pockets. All of them asked me, why they had not ſeene me theſe eight daies? But when we were come vp to the ſtaires-head, and that by the light of the windowes they ſaw mee, they were all amazed, and looked one vpon another as if they had beene Matachines; and in the end brake out into ſuch laughter, that

                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:5419:96"/> one would haue thought they did it for a Wager, none of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to vtter one word. The firſt that ſpoke, was a little Boy, that ſaid, This is not my Daddy. But when this flux of Laughter was ſomewhat ouer, the Women (who were foure) asked mee for whom I begged? I told them, for Saint <hi>Lazaro.</hi> For Saint <hi>Lazaro,</hi> ſaid they? Why, is not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Anſelmo</hi> well? Well? (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red I) yes ſure, hee complayneth of nothing, for hee dyed eight dayes agoe. When they heard this, they fell all a roaring; and if their Laughing had beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore great, their Wayling was now greater. Some cryed; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers pulled themſelues by the hayres; all of them together made ſuch a jarring Muſique, that a Quire of hoarſe Nunnes could ſcarce make a worſe. One
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:5419:96"/> ſaid, What ſhall become of mee Wretch that I am, without a Husband, without Defence, and without Counſaile? Whither ſhall I goe? Who ſhall maintayne mee? O heauie newes! What miſchance is this? Another brake out thus: My deare Sonne in Law, and Maſter! How haue you forſaken vs, without bidding vs farewell? O my poore little Children, now Orphants, and comfortleſſe, where is your good Father? The little Brats held the <hi>Superius</hi> of that vntuned Muſique. Euery one wept, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one tooke on; there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Sobs, nothing but Waylings. But when the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of that great Deluge grew ſomewhat towards an Ebbe, they enquired of mee, how, and of what Diſeaſe hee dyed. I tolde it them; as alſo, the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:5419:97"/> Will which he made, leauing and ordaining me for his lawfull heire and ſucceſſor. There was the blow. It was there that teares was turned into fury, ſobs vnto blaſphemies and wailings into threatnings. You are ſome thieſe that haue murthered him, to rob him; but you ſhall not brag of it (ſaid the yongeſt) for that Hermite was my husband, and theſe three children are his: and vnleſſe you do giue vs all his goods, and reſtore vnto mee a garment that I lent him to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe himſelfe vpon Shroue-Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, we will make you be hanged: and if iuſtice be denyed, there are Swords and Piſtols in the world, wherewith to make you looſe a thouſand liues, if ſo many you had. I told them that I had ſufficient witneſſes, before whom hee had made his wil. Theſe are all tricks &amp; gulleries (ſayd they) for the ſame
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:5419:97"/> day that you ſay hee died, hee was here, and told vs, that hee had no companie. After I had conſidered with my ſelf, that the Will had not been made vnder the hands of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, and that thoſe Women did threaten me; for the experience that I had of Law, and Suits, I determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſpeake them faire, to try if by that meanes I might compaſſe that which by Law I was aſſured to loſe: as alſo, for that the teares of the young Widow had penetrated to the interior parts of my heart. And ſo I deſired them to be quiet, telling them, that they ſhould loſe nothing by me; and that if I had accepted to be his Heire, it was onely becauſe I thought that the deceaſed was no married man, hauing neuer heard before that Hermits were married. They (all ſadneſſe and melancholy being caſt off) began to laugh, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That they ſaw well that I was a
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:5419:98"/> Nouice, and little experimented in that Office, ſince I knew not, that when an Hermite is termed ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, it is meant that hee is to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtred from the company and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie of men, and not of women; for there is not any, but hath one at the leaſt, with whom hee may paſſe in exerciſes of action, the vacant time, from thoſe of Speculation; imitating in that your holy Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors: and ſo much the more, by reaſon that they are perſons that are better informed of the Will of God, who hath ordained, that man ſhould not be alone: And therefore they, like dutifull &amp; obedient Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, haue each of them one or two wiues, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they maintaine, though it be euen of Almes; &amp; particularly, the vnhappie Wretch that is dead, who nouriſhed and kept foure; that poore Widow, and I that am her Mother, and thoſe two her Siſters,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:5419:98"/> beſides thoſe three Infants that are his Children, or at leaſt that he held for ſuch. Then ſhe, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſaid to be his Wife, ſaid, That ſhee would not be called the Widow of that old rotten carkaſſe, that had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred her at his death; and that ſhee would bee ſworne, that thoſe Children were none of his; and that from that time ſhee did annull and breake all contracts of Matrimony made betweene them. I then asked her, what the contents of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract were? The Mother replyed, ſaying, The Matrimoniall couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts that I made, when I married my daughter with that vngrateful man, were theſe that follow; which, that you may the better vnderſtand, I muſt of neceſſitie begin farther off. I liued heretofore in a Towne cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Ducnas,</hi> ſome twelue miles he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, hauing onely remaining theſe three daughters, of three ſundry fathers,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:5419:99"/> who (to the neereſt coniecture) were a Monke, an Abbot, and a Prieſt, for I haue bin alwayes much deuoted vnto the Church. But at length I came to dwel in this City, to eſchew the rumors which are frequent in ſuch little places; for euery one termed me the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Widow, by reaſon that (to my griefe) all three of them were dead. And though others preſently did ſupply their places, they were men of little gaine, and of leſſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie; who not contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with the Mother, layd ſnares to entrap the young ones: which to preuent, ſeeing the danger eminent, and that the gaine was not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to maintaine vs, here I pitched, and began to ſet vp. At the report of the three Wenches, ſuitors came as thick as Gnats to the Wine-tap; but to none of them all did I euer incline ſo much as to Churchmen,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:5419:99"/> being perſons that are ſecret, rich, thriftie, and patient. Now among others, the Hermite of S. <hi>Lazaro</hi> came a begging, and ſeeing this Maid, fell in loue with her, and in holineſſe and ſimplicitie did deſire her of me for his Wife. I clapped vp the Match vpon theſe Articles and Conditions that I wil tell you. Firſt, hee obliged himſelfe to feede our whole houſehold; and what we our ſelues could earne, ſhould be to apparrell vs, &amp; to put vp. Secondly, that if at any time my daughter did admit any Coadiutor (hee being ſomewhat old and craſie) he ſhould not make any words of it. Thirdly, that he ſhould hold and eſteeme as his owne, all the Children that ſhee ſhould beare, to whom from that inſtant he aſſured all whatſoeuer he did or might poſſeſſe; &amp; that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to paſſe, that my daughter ſhould he without iſſue, hee did
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:5419:100"/> make her his ſole and lawfull heire. Fourthly, that he was not to come into our houſe, when he ſhould ſee a Iarre, Pot, or other Veſſell at the Window; a token, that then there was no roome for him. Fiftly, that if, hee being in the houſe, any other did come, he was then to hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe where wee ſhould bid him, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the other were departed. Sixtly and laſtly, that he ſhould be a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, to bring hither twice euery weeke ſome friend or acquaintance of his, to make merry with vs at their owne charges. Theſe are (ſaid ſhe) the conditions, vpon the which that Wretch betrothed himſelfe to my daughter, and ſhe to him. The Marriage was made &amp; ended, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either Prieſt or Curate; for hee told me that it was needleſſe, ſince the eſſence thereof did conſiſt only in conformitie of mindes and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall intentions. I was amazed at
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:5419:100"/> the ſpeeches of that other <hi>Celeſtina,</hi> and at the Articles of her daughters marriage: I was perplext, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what to ſay, vntill they opened a paſſage to my deſires; for the yong Widow fel about my neck, ſaying, If that vnhappy man had had this Angels face, how much ſhould I haue loued him? and with that, ſhee kiſſed me. After this kiſſe, there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into me I know not what, that began to ſet me a fire; ſo that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any delay, or farther diſcourſe, I told her, That if ſhe were minded to forſake her Widow-hood, and receiue me as her owne, I would not onely keepe and fulfill my Predeceſſors Couenants, but all others whatſoeuer that they would adde. They were well pleaſed with that, and ſayd, That they onely deſired, that I ſhould put into their hands all that which was in the Hermitage, and that they
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:5419:101"/> would keepe it. I promiſed them ſo to doe, but with intent to conceale the Money for a need. The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Match was referred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the next day; and that afternoone they ſent a Cart to the Cell, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they carryed away all, euen to the aſhes, not forbearing ſo much as the Altar-Cloth, or the Saints Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I was ſo loue-nettled, that if they had asked me the Phoenix, or Water out of the <hi>Stygian</hi> Lake, I would haue giuen it them. They left me nothing but a poore Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, whereon I might caſt my ſelfe like a Dogge. When the good La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; my future Wife (who came with the Cart) ſaw that there was no Money, ſhee was angry (for the old man had told her that hee had ſome, but not where) and asked me if I did not know where the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure lay? I told her, No. She, craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and ſubtill as ſhe was, tooke me
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:5419:101"/> by the hand, that we might go ſeeke it together, &amp; caryed me into euery hole and corner of the Hermitage. As wee went about the Altar, ſhee perceiued the ſide of the Wall which was newly made vp, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſhee entred into ſuſpition of me. And therefore embracing and kiſſing me, ſhe ſaid vnto me, I pray thee my Loue tell me where the Money is, that we may make a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Wedding with it. I ſtill denyed that I knew of any. Then ſhe taking me againe by the hand, made me walke out round about the Hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, ſtill looking me in the Face; and when wee came to the place where I had hid the Money, my eyes were inſtantly towards it. She, who all this while watched but for that action, called ſtraightwayes to her Mother, bidding her ſeek vnder a Stone that I had layd there; which ſhe doing, met with the Mony, and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:5419:102"/> I with my death. But ſhee diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, ſaying, Looke here, wee will liue a merry life with this. Then ſhewing me all manner of kindnes, they preſently (becauſe it grew late) retired to the Citie, and left me vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the next morning, that I was to goe to their houſe, where we ſhould make the merrieſt Wedding that euer was ſeene. God grant it (ſaid I to my ſelfe.) All that night I ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced betweene hope and feare, Ieaſt thoſe Women ſhould deceiue me, although it ſeemed vnpoſſible vnto me, that a falſe heart ſhould lurke vnder ſo good a face; for, as the <hi>Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key</hi> ſaid, If thy face be good, thy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions wil be anſwerable. That night was a yeere to me. It was yet ſcarce day, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as locking vp my Hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, I went to be married, as if that had bin but a ſlight matter; not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that <hi>Eluira</hi> was my wife. I came to the houſe at their riſing;
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:5419:102"/> where they receiued me with ſuch ioy, that I accounted my ſelf a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py man; &amp; all feare layd aſide, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ordaine and command as in my owne houſe. Wee made ſuch good cheare, &amp; with ſuch content, that I thought I was in a Paradiſe: We wanted not company, for they had inuited fiue or ſix Women of their friends. After Dinner we fel to dancing; and, though I was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant therein, they forced me to doe the like. It was the beſt ſport in the world to ſee me hobble vp &amp; downe in my Hermits attire. But night being come, after a good Supper, &amp; better drinking, they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried me into a faire chamber, where there was a good Bed, and bad me make my ſelfe vnready, &amp; go to bed firſt, whilſt my Bride was vndreſſing. I did ſo, though co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, where the woman hath that prerogatine. A maid was
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:5419:103"/> left to helpe me off with my Stoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, who told me, that I muſt put off my Shirt, for it was requiſit that for ſome Ceremonies that were yet to be performed, I ſhould be ſtarke naked. I obeyed her: but I was no ſooner in the Bed, but all the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and my Bride among them, ruſhed into the Chamber; and the firſt thing they did, two of them tooke me by the feet, &amp; two by the armes, &amp; tied inſtantly foure cords about them, wherewith they bound me to the foure Bed-Poſts, leauing me ſtretched like a S. <hi>Andrew</hi> vpon a Croſſe; whereupon they all fell a laughing like mad folkes, &amp; I aroa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring like a Bull. But they told me, vnleſſe I held my peace, that I was a dead man. Then they tooke a great Baſin of hot Water, wherein they popped my head. I burned my ſelf, &amp; which was worſe, if I thought to cry out, they ſo belaced me with
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:5419:103"/> ſtripes, that I was conſtrained to let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do their pleaſure. They ſcalded off my Beard, haire, eye-browes, and eye-lids, ſaying, A little more pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, &amp; the Ceremonies will be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, &amp; you ſhall enioy your deſire. I entreated them to let me goe, for my itch of marrying was now coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. But one of the boldeſt of them drawing out a Knife, ſaid to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Hold him faſt, and I will gold him a little, that his mortified fleſh may not another time be tempted to copulation. The holy Hermite beleeued (I thinke) that all wee told him had beene Goſpel, but y faith it was not, nor Epiſtle neyther. Hee would truſt to women; he ſhall ſee now what will come on't. When I ſaw my precious ſtones in ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, I ſtrugled in ſuch manner, as I brake one of the Cords, &amp; withall, one of the Bed-Poſts; being anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a deſire that I had, to keepe
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:5419:104"/> my Bells for a Morris-dance. They ſeeing what I had done, for feare leſt I ſhould breake all the Bed, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound me, &amp; putting me in a Sheet, they toſſed me ſo long, that they left me for dead. Theſe are, ſayd they, Sir, the ceremonies wherwith our Wedding begins; if it pleaſe you to come againe to morrow, we will make an end of the reſt: &amp; with that, foure of them took me vp, and carryed me a good way from their houſe, and layd me in the midſt of the Street; where the Day found me, and the Boyes began to run af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me, and doe me a great deale of miſchiefe: ſo that, to auoyd them, I ran into a Church, cloſe to the High Altar, where they were at Maſſe. When the Prieſts ſaw ſuch a ſight, which queſtionleſſe reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Deuill that Painters vſe to lay vnder S. <hi>Michaels</hi> feet; they all ran away, &amp; I among them, to free
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:5419:104"/> my ſelfe from the miſdemeanors of thoſe Deuils incarnate. The people that was in the Church, cryed out; ſome, Take heed of the Deuill; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Beware of the Mad-man. I cryed out as well as they, that I was neyther Deuill, nor Mad-man, but onely a poore fellow, whom God for my ſinnes had viſited with that miſerie. When they perceiued, that I was not what they took me to be, they all were quieted; the Prieſts returned backe againe, to make an end of their Maſſe; and the Sexton gaue me the Cloth of a Tombe, to wrap my ſelfe in. I went into a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, where I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered the croſſes of Fortune, &amp; how on euery ſide man is beſet with miſerie; and therfore I determined to abide in that church &amp; there end my dayes (which, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of my former woes, could not be very long) and ſaue the Prieſts a labor of fetching me elſwhere, after my death.</p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:5419:105"/>
               <p> This is in ſumme (courteous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) the ſecond Part of the Life of <hi>Lazarillo,</hi> without either adding or diminiſhing, but euen as I haue heard my great Grandmother tell it. If thou doeſt like it, expect the third Part, which ſhall no leſſe delight thee.</p>
